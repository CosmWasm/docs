# Prerequisites

To use Sylvia follow the [`installation`](../../core/installation) process for
the `CosmWasm core`.

## Verifying the installation

To guarantee you are ready to build your smart contracts, you must ensure you
can build examples. Checkout the [sylvia](https://github.com/CosmWasm/sylvia)
repository and run the testing command in its folder:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/sylvia.git
$ cd sylvia
sylvia $ cargo test
```

You should see that everything in the repository gets compiled and all tests
pass.

Sylvia framework contains some examples of contracts. To find them go to
`examples/contracts` directory. These contracts are maintained by CosmWasm
creators, so contracts in there should follow good practices.

## Macro expansion

Sylvia generates a lot of code for us, which is not visible right away. To see
the generated code, go to `examples/contracts/cw1-whitelist/src/contract.rs`.

In VSCode you can click on `#[contract]`, do `shift+p` and then type:
`rust analyzer: Expand macro recursively`. This will open a window with a fully
expanded macro, which you can browse.

In Vim you can consider installing the
[rustaceanvim](https://github.com/mrcjkb/rustaceanvim) plugin.

You can also use `cargo expand` tool from CLI, like this:

```shell
sylvia/examples/contracts/cw1-whitelist $ cargo expand --lib
```

## Generate contract from template

To make Sylvia contract easier to setup we created the
[`sylvia template`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/sylvia-template).

```shell
cargo generate CosmWasm/sylvia-template
```

You will be prompted to provide project name. Once you choose it you are ready
to go.
