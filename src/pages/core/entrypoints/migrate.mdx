# Migrate

This is another special endpoint. It is, just like `instantiate`, not called
frequently.

`migrate` is only called once you upload a new version to the chain and lets you
run all the required changes to the storage.

Let's say your storage has the following layout, expressed as JSON for
simplicity's sake:

```json filename="structure.json"
{
  "user_count": 205,
  "call_count": 543,
  "balance": 43
}
```

But then you notice "Hey! Why don't I nest all the counts into an own object?
That way I don't have that redundant postfix, making the keys smaller".

So you go ahead and rework your logic to query the data from the following
structure:

```json filename="structure.json"
{
  "count": {
    "user": 205,
    "call": 543
  },
  "balance": 43
}
```

But your storage on-chain still stores the old format. You need to somehow
transform it.

That's what you do in the `migrate` entrypoint. You transform the structure of
the storage in there.

## Example

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
const CONTRACT_NAME: &str = "my_contract";
const STATE_VERSION: &str = "v2";

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn migrate(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, _msg: MigrateMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // Check if the state version is older than the current one and update it
    cw2::ensure_from_older_version(deps.storage, CONTRACT_NAME, STATE_VERSION)?;

    // Load the old data
    let Some(old_data) = deps.storage.get(b"persisted_data") else {
      return Err(StdError::generic_err("Data not found"));
    };
    // Deserialize it from the old format
    let old_data: OldData = cosmwasm_std::from_json(&old_data)?;

    // Transform it
    let new_data = transform(old_data);

    // Serialize the new data
    let new_data = cosmwasm_std::to_json_vec(&new_data)?;
    // Store the new data
    deps.storage.set(b"persisted_data", &new_data);

    Ok(Response::default())
}
```
