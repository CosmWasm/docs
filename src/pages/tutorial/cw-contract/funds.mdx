# Dealing with funds

When you hear "smart contracts", you think "blockchain". When you hear blockchain, you often think
of cryptocurrencies. It is not the same, but crypto assets, or as we often call them: tokens, are
very closely connected to the blockchain. CosmWasm has a notion of a native token. Native tokens are
assets managed by the blockchain core instead of smart contracts. Often such assets have some
special meaning, like being used for paying
[gas fees](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.52/learn/beginner/gas-fees) or
[staking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) for consensus algorithm, but can be just
arbitrary assets.

Native tokens are assigned to their owners but can be transferred. Everything have an address in the
blockchain is eligible to have its native tokens. As a consequence - tokens can be assigned to smart
contracts! Every message sent to the smart contract can have some funds sent with it. In this
chapter, we will take advantage of that and create a way to reward hard work performed by admins. We
will create a new message - `Donate`, which will be used by anyone to donate some funds to admins,
divided equally.

## Preparing messages

Traditionally we need to prepare our messages. We need to create a new `ExecuteMsg` variant, but we
will also modify the `Instantiate` message a bit - we need to have some way of defining the name of
a native token we would use for donations. It would be possible to allow users to send any tokens
they want, but we want to simplify things for now.

```rust {7, 14} filename="src/msg.rs" template="empty"
use cosmwasm_std::Addr;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
    pub admins: Vec<String>,
    pub donation_denom: String,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    AddMembers { admins: Vec<String> },
    Leave {},
    Donate {},
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct GreetResp {
    pub message: String,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct AdminsListResp {
    pub admins: Vec<Addr>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    Greet {},
    AdminsList {},
}
```

We also need to add a new state part, to keep the `donation_denom`:

<Tabs items={['Storey', 'StoragePlus']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```rust {5, 7} filename="src/state.rs" template="empty"
use cosmwasm_std::Addr;
use cw_storey::containers::Item;

const ADMIN_ID: u8 = 0;
const DONATION_DENOM_ID: u8 = 1;
pub const ADMINS: Item<Vec<Addr>> = Item::new(ADMIN_ID);
pub const DONATION_DENOM: Item<String> = Item::new(DONATION_DENOM_ID);
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```rust {5} filename="src/state.rs" template="empty"
use cosmwasm_std::Addr;
use cw_storage_plus::Item;

pub const ADMINS: Item<Vec<Addr>> = Item::new("admins");
pub const DONATION_DENOM: Item<String> = Item::new("donation_denom");
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

And instantiate it properly:

<Tabs items={['Storey', 'StoragePlus']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```rust {3, 21-23} filename="src/contract.rs"
use crate::error::ContractError;
use crate::msg::{ExecuteMsg, GreetResp, InstantiateMsg, QueryMsg};
use crate::state::{ADMINS, DONATION_DENOM};
use cosmwasm_std::{to_json_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult};
use cw_storey::CwStorage;

pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    let admins = msg
        .admins
        .into_iter()
        .map(|addr| deps.api.addr_validate(&addr))
        .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()?;

    let mut cw_storage = CwStorage(deps.storage);
    ADMINS.access(&mut cw_storage).set(&admins)?;
    DONATION_DENOM
        .access(&mut cw_storage)
        .set(&msg.donation_denom)?;

    Ok(Response::new())
}

// ...
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```rust {3, 18} filename="src/contract.rs"
use crate::error::ContractError;
use crate::msg::{AdminsListResp, ExecuteMsg, GreetResp, InstantiateMsg, QueryMsg};
use crate::state::{ADMINS, DONATION_DENOM};
use cosmwasm_std::{to_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult};

pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    let admins: StdResult<Vec<_>> = msg
        .admins
        .into_iter()
        .map(|addr| deps.api.addr_validate(&addr))
        .collect();
    ADMINS.save(deps.storage, &admins?)?;
    DONATION_DENOM.save(deps.storage, &msg.donation_denom?)?;

    Ok(Response::new())
}
```

What also needs some corrections are tests - instantiate messages have a new field. I leave it to
you as an exercise. Now we have everything we need to implement donating funds to admins. First, a
minor update to the `Cargo.toml` - we will use an additional utility crate:

<Tabs items={['Storey', 'StoragePlus']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```toml {14} filename="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "contract"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2.1.4", features = ["staking"] }
serde = { version = "1.0.214", default-features = false, features = ["derive"] }
cw-storey = "0.4.0"
thiserror = "2.0.3"
cw-utils = "2.0.0"

[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = "2.2.0"
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```toml {14} filename="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "contract"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2.1.4", features = ["staking"] }
serde = { version = "1.0.214", default-features = false, features = ["derive"] }
cw-storage-plus = "2.0.0"
thiserror = "2.0.3"
cw-utils = "2.0.0"

[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = "2.2.0"
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Then we can implement the donate handler:

<Tabs items={['Storey', 'StoragePlus']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```rust {22, 33-55} filename="src/contract.rs"
use crate::error::ContractError;
use crate::msg::{AdminsListResp, ExecuteMsg, GreetResp, InstantiateMsg, QueryMsg};
use crate::state::{ADMINS, DONATION_DENOM};
use cosmwasm_std::{
    coins, to_binary, BankMsg, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, Event, MessageInfo,
    Response, StdResult,
};

// ...

pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    use ExecuteMsg::*;

    match msg {
        AddMembers { admins } => exec::add_members(deps, info, admins),
        Leave {} => exec::leave(deps, info).map_err(Into::into),
        Donate {} => exec::donate(deps, info),
    }
}

mod exec {
    use cosmwasm_std::{coins, BankMsg, Event};

    use super::*;

    // ...

    pub fn donate(deps: DepsMut, info: MessageInfo) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
        let cw_storage = CwStorage(deps.storage);

        let denom = DONATION_DENOM.access(&cw_storage).get()?.unwrap();
        let admins = ADMINS.access(&cw_storage).get()?.unwrap();

        let donation = cw_utils::must_pay(&info, &denom)?.u128();

        let donation_per_admin = donation / (admins.len() as u128);

        let messages = admins.into_iter().map(|admin| BankMsg::Send {
            to_address: admin.to_string(),
            amount: coins(donation_per_admin, &denom),
        });

        let resp = Response::new()
            .add_messages(messages)
            .add_attribute("action", "donate")
            .add_attribute("amount", donation.to_string())
            .add_attribute("per_admin", donation_per_admin.to_string());

        Ok(resp)
    }
}
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```rust {22, 33-55} filename="src/contract.rs"
use crate::error::ContractError;
use crate::msg::{AdminsListResp, ExecuteMsg, GreetResp, InstantiateMsg, QueryMsg};
use crate::state::{ADMINS, DONATION_DENOM};
use cosmwasm_std::{
    coins, to_binary, BankMsg, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, Event, MessageInfo,
    Response, StdResult,
};

// ...

pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    use ExecuteMsg::*;

    match msg {
        AddMembers { admins } => exec::add_members(deps, info, admins),
        Leave {} => exec::leave(deps, info).map_err(Into::into),
        Donate {} => exec::donate(deps, info),
    }
}

mod exec {
    use cosmwasm_std::{coins, BankMsg, Event};

    use super::*;

    // ...

    pub fn donate(deps: DepsMut, info: MessageInfo) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
        let denom = DONATION_DENOM.load(deps.storage)?;
        let admins = ADMINS.load(deps.storage)?;

        let donation = cw_utils::must_pay(&info, &denom)?.u128();

        let donation_per_admin = donation / (admins.len() as u128);

        let messages = admins.into_iter().map(|admin| BankMsg::Send {
            to_address: admin.to_string(),
            amount: coins(donation_per_admin, &denom),
        });

        let resp = Response::new()
            .add_messages(messages)
            .add_attribute("action", "donate")
            .add_attribute("amount", donation.to_string())
            .add_attribute("per_admin", donation_per_admin.to_string());

        Ok(resp)
    }
}
```

Sending the funds to another contract is performed by adding bank messages to the response. The
blockchain would expect any message which is returned in contract response as a part of an
execution. This design is related to an actor model implemented by CosmWasm. You can read about it
[here](../../core/architecture/actor-model), but for now, you can assume this is a way to handle
token transfers. Before sending tokens to admins, we have to calculate the amount of donation per
admin. It is done by searching funds for an entry describing our donation token and dividing the
number of tokens sent by the number of admins. Note that because the integral division is always
rounding down.

As a consequence, it is possible that not all tokens sent as a donation would end up with no admins
accounts. Any leftover would be left on our contract account forever. There are plenty of ways of
dealing with this issue - figuring out one of them would be a great exercise.

The last missing part is updating the `ContractError` - the `must_pay` call returns a
`cw_utils::PaymentError` which we can't convert to our error type yet:

```rust {2, 11-12} filename="src/error.rs" template="empty"
use cosmwasm_std::{Addr, StdError};
use cw_utils::PaymentError;
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum ContractError {
    #[error("{0}")]
    StdError(#[from] StdError),
    #[error("{sender} is not contract admin")]
    Unauthorized { sender: Addr },
    #[error("Payment error: {0}")]
    Payment(#[from] PaymentError),
}
```

As you can see, to handle incoming funds, I used the utility function - I encourage you to take a
look at [its implementation](https://docs.rs/cw-utils/latest/src/cw_utils/payment.rs.html#32-39) -
this would give you a good understanding of how incoming funds are structured in `MessageInfo`.

Now it's time to check if the funds are distributed correctly. The way for that is to write a test.

```rust filename="src/contract.rs"
// ...

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use cosmwasm_std::coins;
    use cw_multi_test::{App, ContractWrapper, Executor, IntoAddr};

    use crate::msg::AdminsListResp;

    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn donations() {
        let owner = "owner".into_addr();
        let user = "user".into_addr();
        let admin1 = "admin1".into_addr();
        let admin2 = "admin2".into_addr();

        let mut app = App::new(|router, _, storage| {
            router
                .bank
                .init_balance(storage, &user, coins(5, "eth"))
                .unwrap()
        });

        let code = ContractWrapper::new(execute, instantiate, query);
        let code_id = app.store_code(Box::new(code));

        let addr = app
            .instantiate_contract(
                code_id,
                owner,
                &InstantiateMsg {
                    admins: vec![admin1.to_string(), admin2.to_string()],
                    donation_denom: "eth".to_owned(),
                },
                &[],
                "Contract",
                None,
            )
            .unwrap();

        app.execute_contract(
            user.clone(),
            addr.clone(),
            &ExecuteMsg::Donate {},
            &coins(5, "eth"),
        )
        .unwrap();

        assert_eq!(
            app.wrap()
                .query_balance(user.as_str(), "eth")
                .unwrap()
                .amount
                .u128(),
            0
        );

        assert_eq!(
            app.wrap()
                .query_balance(&addr, "eth")
                .unwrap()
                .amount
                .u128(),
            1
        );

        assert_eq!(
            app.wrap()
                .query_balance(admin1.as_str(), "eth")
                .unwrap()
                .amount
                .u128(),
            2
        );

        assert_eq!(
            app.wrap()
                .query_balance(admin2.as_str(), "eth")
                .unwrap()
                .amount
                .u128(),
            2
        );
    }
}
```

Fairly simple. I don't particularly appreciate that every balance check is eight lines of code, but
it can be improved by enclosing this assertion into a separate function, probably with the
[`#[track_caller]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/diagnostics.html#the-track_caller-attribute)
attribute.

The critical thing to talk about is how `app` creation changed. Because we need some initial tokens
on a `user` account, instead of using the default constructor, we have to provide it with an
initializer function. Unfortunately, even though the
[`new`](https://docs.rs/cw-multi-test/latest/cw_multi_test/struct.App.html#method.new) function is
not very complicated, it's not easy to use. What it takes as an argument is a closure with three
arguments - the [`Router`](https://docs.rs/cw-multi-test/latest/cw_multi_test/struct.Router.html)
with all modules supported by multi-test, the API object, and the state. This function is called
once during contract instantiation. The `router` object contains some generic fields - we are
interested in `bank` in particular. It has a type of
[`BankKeeper`](https://docs.rs/cw-multi-test/latest/cw_multi_test/struct.BankKeeper.html), where the
[`init_balance`](https://docs.rs/cw-multi-test/latest/cw_multi_test/struct.BankKeeper.html#method.init_balance)
function sits.

## Plot Twist

As we covered most of the important basics about building Rust smart contracts, I have a serious
exercise for you.

The contract we built has an exploitable bug. All donations are distributed equally across admins.
However, every admin is eligible to add another admin. And nothing is preventing the admin from
adding himself to the list and receiving twice as many rewards as others!

Try to write a test that detects such a bug, then fix it and ensure the bug nevermore occurs.

Even if the admin cannot add the same address to the list, he can always create new accounts and add
them. Handling this kind of case is done by properly designing whole applications, which is out of
this chapter's scope.
