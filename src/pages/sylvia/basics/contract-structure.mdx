# Contract structure

Sylvia contracts are designed using the actor model. An actor is a contract
struct that can store a state and define a behavior.

```rust
use sylvia::cw_storage_plus::Item;

pub struct CounterContract {
    pub count: Item<u64>,
}
```

In Sylvia we keep the state accessors as part of the contract definition. The
accessors are [`cw_storage_plus`](../../cw-storage-plus) primitives.

Let's take a look at the behavior implementation.

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), sylvia::entry_points)]
#[contract]
impl CounterContract {
    pub const fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            count: Item::new("count"),
        }
    }

    #[sv::msg(instantiate)]
    fn instantiate(&self, ctx: InstantiateCtx) -> StdResult<Response> {
        self.count.save(ctx.deps.storage, &0)?;
        Ok(Response::new())
    }

    #[sv::msg(exec)]
    fn increment(&self, ctx: ExecCtx) -> StdResult<Response> {
        self.count
            .update(ctx.deps.storage, |count| -> StdResult<u64> {
                Ok(count + 1)
            })?;
        Ok(Response::new())
    }

    #[sv::msg(query)]
    fn count(&self, ctx: QueryCtx) -> StdResult<CountResponse> {
        let count = self.count.load(ctx.deps.storage)?;
        Ok(CountResponse { count })
    }
}
```

In the first two lines, we see the usage of two macros:

- [`entry_points`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/attr.entry_points.html) -
  Generates entry points of the contract. By default it will generate
  `instantiate`, `execute` and `query` entry points. The other ones, `migrate`,
  `reply`, and `sudo`, are generated if a behavior related to them is defined in
  the `impl` block.

  This macro is wrapped in `cfg_attr` statement to be compiled only if `library`
  feature flag is not enabled. This way, other users who might want to use this
  contract in theirs won't get an entry point collision.

- [`contract`](../macros/contract) - Parses every method inside the `impl` block
  marked with the `[sv::msg(...)]` attribute and create proper messages and
  utilities like helpers for [`MultiTest`](../../cw-multi-test).

This simple example also has the `sv::msg(...)` attributes. Sylvia macros
distinguish the if message should be generated from the marked method and of
what type.

CosmWasm contract requires the `instantiate` message, and it is mandatory to
specify it for the `contract` macro. We have to provide it with the proper
context type:
[`InstantiateCtx`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.InstantiateCtx.html).
Another mandatory method is the `new`, as contract fields are out of scope for
the `contract` macro, and otherwise we wouldn't be able to create the contract
object in message dispatching.

Context gives us access to the blockchain state, information about our contract,
and the sender of the message. We return the
[`StdResult`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/type.StdResult.html)
which uses standard CosmWasm error
[`StdError`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/enum.StdError.html).
It's generic over
[`Response`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.Response.html).

The template contract also contains a query and an exec messages. Each type of
message in CosmWasm supports different contexts. F.e. the
[`QueryCtx`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.QueryCtx.html)
exposes to the user an immutable
[`Deps`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.Deps.html) as
by design, queries should never mutate the state. This is not the case for the
[`ExecCtx`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.ExecCtx.html) and
`InstantiateCtx` which exposes the
[`DepsMut`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.DepsMut.html).

Fell free expanding the macro now and seeing what Sylvia generates. It might be
overwhelming, as there will be a lot of things generated that seem not relevant
to our code, so for the bare minimum, check the `InstantiateMsg` and its `impl`
block.

Sylvia doesn't generate anything magical, but regular CosmWasm contract types
customized based on the provided methods and attributes. This means that the
Sylvia contract is fully interoperational with the standard CosmWasm contract.
