# Testing onion

## Test placement

### Unit tests placed directly in source files under `src` directory

<Callout emoji="ðŸŽ¯" type="info">
  **Purpose**: Testing private functionality of the smart contract.
</Callout>

Non-trivial smart contracts implement all required (public) entry points, as
well as multiple functions that are used internally within these entry points.
Internally-used functions like these are typically defined as private within the
smart contract's source file, which means there is no direct way to test them
from outside of this file. Such unit tests are usually placed in a separate
submodule or directly as a test function.

**Examples**:

```rust
// example of a test defined directly as a function
```

```rust
// example of a test function placed in submodule
```

### Tests placed in separate module under `src` directory

<Callout emoji="ðŸŽ¯" type="info">
  Testing the public functionality of the module used by smart contract.
</Callout>

Testing public functionality of the module but private functionality of the
whole library. Private functionality of the source file is not visible for these
tests.

```rust
// example of test functions placed in a separate module under `src` directory
```

**Examples**:

### Tests placed in dedicated `tests` directory

<Callout emoji="ðŸŽ¯" type="info">
  Testing the public functionality (entry points) of a single smart contract.
</Callout>

- test public functionality of the library (library integration tests)
- private functionality of the library is not visible for these tests

**Examples**:

```rust
// example of such tests
```

### Tests placed in a dedicated crate inside workspace

<Callout emoji="ðŸŽ¯" type="info">
  Testing interactions among multiple smart contracts running on the same
  blockchain.
</Callout>

**Examples**:

```rust
// example of such crate
```

### Tests placed in a separated project (???)

<Callout emoji="ðŸŽ¯" type="info">
  Testing interactions among multiple smart contracts running on different
  blockchains.
</Callout>

IBC case.

**Examples**:

```rust
// example of such crate
```
