# Permissions

This section describes the permission settings, enabling you to manage access to essential
operations like uploading and instantiating Wasm contracts.

## Chain Permissions

The `wasm` module provides configurable settings to control who can upload and instantiate Wasm
binaries. These settings are managed through the Cosmos-SDKâ€™s `params` module.

### Parameters

`"code_upload_access"`: This setting determines who is permitted to upload Wasm binaries to the
blockchain.

- `Nobody`: Disables Wasm binary uploads for everyone.
- `Everybody`: Allows anyone to upload a Wasm binary.
- `AnyOfAddresses`: Restricts Wasm binary uploads to specific addresses.

`"instantiate_default_permission"`: This setting defines the default permission for who can
instantiate a Wasm binary if the code owner has not explicitly set this permission.

- `Nobody`: No one is allowed to instantiate the Wasm binary.
- `Everybody`: Any user on the blockchain can instantiate the Wasm binary.
- `AnyOfAddresses`: Only the specified addresses can instantiate the Wasm binary.

### Genesis File Configuration

During the initial setup of the blockchain, you can configure these parameters in the genesis file
as follows:

```json
    "wasm": {
      "params": {
        "code_upload_access": {
          "permission": "Everybody"
        },
        "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
      }
    },
```

### Updating Chain Permissions

After the chain has been initialized, you can update these parameters through a governance proposal
using the `MsgUpdateParams` message type. The `MsgUpdateParams` message type is used to propose
changes to the blockchain's configuration parameters via governance.

#### Drafting the Proposal

Use the interactive CLI tool to draft a governance proposal:

```sh
wasmd tx gov draft-proposal
```

#### Submitting the Proposal

Once the draft is prepared, submit the proposal using the following command:

```sh
wasmd tx gov submit-proposal draft_proposal.json  --from alice --keyring-backend=test --chain-id=docs-chain-1
```

### Example Scenarios

Below are a few examples demonstrating how to configure different scenarios for Wasm code upload
permissions using governance proposals:

**Disable Wasm Code Uploads**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "@type": "/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgUpdateParams",
      "authority": "wasm10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700js7zslc",
      "params": {
        "code_upload_access": {
          "permission": "Nobody",
          "addresses": []
        },
        "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": "ipfs://CID",
  "deposit": "1000000stake",
  "title": "Disable Wasm Code Uploads",
  "summary": "This proposal disables the ability for anyone to upload new Wasm binaries.",
  "expedited": false
}
```

**Allow Wasm Code Uploads for Everybody**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "@type": "/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgUpdateParams",
      "authority": "wasm10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700js7zslc",
      "params": {
        "code_upload_access": {
          "permission": "Everybody",
          "addresses": []
        },
        "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": "ipfs://CID",
  "deposit": "1000000stake",
  "title": "Allow Wasm code uploads for everybody",
  "summary": "This proposal enables the ability for anyone to upload new Wasm binaries.",
  "expedited": false
}
```

**Restrict Wasm Code Uploads to Specific Addresses**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "@type": "/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgUpdateParams",
      "authority": "wasm10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700js7zslc",
      "params": {
        "code_upload_access": {
          "permission": "AnyOfAddresses",
          "addresses": [
            "wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku",
            "wasm179avw96aay70ps99umuaesxxczwc0qm5gwufxg"
          ]
        },
        "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": "ipfs://CID",
  "deposit": "1000000stake",
  "title": "Allow Wasm code uploads only for Alice and Bob",
  "summary": "This proposal enables the ability for Alice and Bob to upload new Wasm binaries.",
  "expedited": false
}
```

### Query params

You can query the chain permissions using the following command:

```sh
wasmd q wasm params -o json
```

The output looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "code_upload_access": {
    "permission": "Everybody",
    "addresses": []
  },
  "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
}
```

## Contract Permissions

Granting permissions allows an address to delegate abilities such as performing `store-code`,
`execute`, or `migrate` operations to another address. To grant a permission, the granter must have
that permission. This means that only users who are authorized to perform an action can delegate
that ability to others.

This section explains how to grant and query permissions for storing, executing, and migrating Wasm
contracts on the blockchain.

### Store Code Authorization

To authorize a specific address to store Wasm code, use the following command:

```sh
wasmd tx wasm grant store-code \
    wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku \
    3F4CD47C39C57FE1733FB41ED176EEBD9D5C67BAF5DF8A1EEDA1455E758F8514:everybody \
    --from alice \
    --keyring-backend=test \
    --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
    -y
```

This command allows **Alice** to grant **Bob** (`wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku`) the
authorization to **store** a specific Wasm code on the blockchain. The Wasm code is defined by the
code checksum `3F4CD47C39C57FE1733FB41ED176EEBD9D5C67BAF5DF8A1EEDA1455E758F8514`. The permission
granted allows `"everybody"` to instantiate this code. This means that once **Bob** uploads the Wasm
code, any user on the blockchain will be able to instantiate it.

You can verify the authorization by querying the grants:

```sh
wasmd q authz grants wasm179avw96aay70ps99umuaesxxczwc0qm5gwufxg wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku -o json
```

The output looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "grants": [
    {
      "authorization": {
        "type": "wasm/StoreCodeAuthorization",
        "value": {
          "grants": [
            {
              "code_hash": "M0Y0Q0Q0N0MzOUM1N0ZFMTczM0ZCNDFFRDE3NkVFQkQ5RDVDNjdCQUY1REY4QTFFRURBMTQ1NUU3NThGODUxNA==",
              "instantiate_permission": {}
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": "1"
  }
}
```

### Contract Execution Authorization

To authorize a specific address to execute a Wasm contract, use the following command:

```sh
wasmd tx wasm grant contract \
    wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku execution \
    wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d \
    --allow-all-messages \
    --max-calls 1 \
    --no-token-transfer \
    --expiration 1755772189 \
    --from alice \
    --keyring-backend=test \
    --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
    -y
```

This command allows **Alice** to grant **Bob** (`wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku`) the
authorization to **execute** a specific Wasm smart contract
(wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d). The granted permission allows
**Bob** to execute any message on the contract, but only for a single execution (`--max-calls 1`)
and does not allow token transfers (`--no-token-transfer`). This permission applies to all message
types (`--allow-all-messages`) and will expire at a specified timestamp (`--expiration 1755772189`).

The authorization can be verified by querying the grants:

```json
{
  "grants": [
    {
      "authorization": {
        "type": "wasm/ContractExecutionAuthorization",
        "value": {
          "grants": [
            {
              "contract": "wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d",
              "limit": {
                "type": "wasm/MaxCallsLimit",
                "value": {
                  "remaining": "1"
                }
              },
              "filter": {
                "type": "wasm/AllowAllMessagesFilter",
                "value": {}
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "expiration": "2025-08-21T10:29:49Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Contract Migration Authorization

To authorize a specific address to migrate a Wasm contract, use the following command:

```sh
wasmd tx wasm grant contract wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku migration \
    wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d \
    --allow-all-messages \
    --max-calls 5 \
    --max-funds 100000stake \
    --expiration 1755772189 \
    --from alice \
    --keyring-backend=test \
    --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
    -y
```

This command allows **Alice** to grant **Bob** (`wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku`) the
authorization to **migrate** a specific Wasm smart contract
(`wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d`). The granted permission allows
**Bob** to perform up to five migrations (`--max-calls 5`) with a maximum fund limit of 100,000
stake tokens (`--max-funds 100000stake`). This permission applies to all message types
(`--allow-all-messages`) and will expire at a specified timestamp (`--expiration 1755772189`).

The authorization can be verified by querying the grants:

```json
{
  "grants": [
    {
      "authorization": {
        "type": "wasm/ContractMigrationAuthorization",
        "value": {
          "grants": [
            {
              "contract": "wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d",
              "limit": {
                "type": "wasm/CombinedLimit",
                "value": {
                  "calls_remaining": "5",
                  "amounts": [
                    {
                      "denom": "stake",
                      "amount": "100000"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              },
              "filter": {
                "type": "wasm/AllowAllMessagesFilter",
                "value": {}
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "expiration": "2025-08-21T10:29:49Z"
    }
  ]
}
```
