# Introduction

IBC is a standard that defines how blockchains can send and receive messages to each other. This
allows for the creation of a network of blockchains that can interact with each other.

You can use the IBC protocol as a building block to create your own custom protocols on top of it,
but you can also use existing protocols like the [ICS-20 token transfer protocol]. In the following sections,
we will explain how both of these work. Using CosmWasm for this gives you a key advantage over writing
a custom Cosmos SDK module in Go: you can easily deploy and upgrade your contract without having to go
through a full chain upgrade (on multiple chains, mind you).
