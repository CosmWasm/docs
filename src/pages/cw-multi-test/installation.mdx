# Installation

**`MultiTest`** is as a [Rust] library named [cw-multi-test], and is hosted on [crates.io].

## Usage

To use **`MultiTest`** in your project, simply add it as a **development dependency** to
**Cargo.toml** file:

```toml filename="Cargo.toml" copy
[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = "2"
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸš¨">
  **`MultiTest`** is a **TESTING** library and should **ALWAYS** be added to your project as a
  **DEVELOPMENTÂ DEPENDENCY** in section **`[dev-dependencies]`** of the **Cargo.toml** file.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸš¨">
  **`MultiTest`** **IS NOT** designed to be used in production code on a real-life blockchain.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

### Rust and Cargo

The only prerequisite to test smart contracts using **`MultiTest`** is having [Rust and Cargo]
installed.

<Callout type="info" emoji="â˜‰">
  We recommend installing Rust using the official [rustup installer]. This makes it easy to stay on
  the most recent version of Rust and Cargo.
</Callout>

### Tarpaulin and cargo-nextest

Optionally, you may want to install [Tarpaulin] for measuring code coverage, and [cargo-nextest] for
running tests faster with a clean and beautiful user interface.

Installing **Tarpaulin**:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

Installing **cargo-nextest**:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo install cargo-nextest
```
