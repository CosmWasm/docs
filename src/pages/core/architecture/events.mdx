# Events

CosmWasm can emit [Cosmos Events]. These events are stored in the block execution result as
metadata, allowing the contract to attach metadata to what exactly happened during execution.

<Callout>

Some important details about the keys:

- Whitespaces will be trimmed (i.e. removed from the beginning and end)
- Empty keys (that include keys only consisting of whitespaces) are not allowed
- Keys _cannot_ start with an underscore (`_`). These types of keys are reserved for `wasmd`

</Callout>

By default CosmWasm emits the `wasm` event to which you can add attributes like so:

```rust filename="wasm_event.rs" template="core"
let response: Response<Empty> = Response::new()
    .add_attribute("custom_attribute", "value");
```

## Custom events

As mentioned above, CosmWasm only emits the event `wasm` by default. If you want to emit other
events, such as domain-specific events like `user_added`, you can construct a fully custom event and
attach it to the response.

<Callout>Note that those custom events will be prefixed with `wasm-` by the runtime.</Callout>

```rust filename="custom_event.rs" template="core"
let event = Event::new("custom_event")
    .add_attribute("custom_attribute", "value");

let response: Response<Empty> = Response::new()
    .add_event(event);
```
