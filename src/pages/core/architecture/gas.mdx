# Gas

Gas is a way to measure computational expense of a smart contract execution, including CPU time and
storage cost. Its unit is 1, i.e. you can think of it as countable points. Gas consumption is
deterministic, so executing the same thing costs the same amount of gas across all hardware and
operating systems.

## CosmWasm gas vs. Cosmos SDK gas

CosmWasm charges gas for Wasm operations, calls to host functions and calls to the Cosmos SDK.
_CosmWasm gas_ is different from _Cosmos SDK gas_ as the numbers here are much larger. Since we
charge gas for arbitrary user defined operations, we need to charge each Wasm operation individually
and cannot group larger tasks together. As a result, the gas values become much larger than in
Cosmos SDK even for very fast executions. There is a [multiplier][defaultgasmultiplier] to translate
between CosmWasm gas and Cosmos SDK. It was measured and set to 100 a while ago and can be adjusted
when necessary.

## CosmWasm gas pricing

For CosmWasm gas, the target gas consumption is 1 Teragas (10^12 gas) per second. This idea is
[inspired by NEAR][neargas] and we encourage you to read their excellent docs on that topic.

In order to meet this target, we execute Argon2 in a test contract ([#1120]). This is a CPU and
memory intense job that does not call out into the host. At a constant gas cost per operation of 1
(pre CosmWasm 1.0), this consumed 96837752 gas and took 15ms on our CI system. The ideal cost per
operation for this system is `10^12 / (96837752 / (15 / 1000))`: 154. This is rounded to 150 for
simplicity.

CosmWasm 2.1 update: All gas values were re-evaluated and adjusted to meet the 1 Teragas/second
target mentioned above. A rerun of the Argon2 test contract consumed 5270718300 gas with the
previous cost of 150, so the operation count was `5270718300 / 150 = 35138122`. This took 6ms on our
benchmark server, so the new cost per operation is `10^12 / (35138122 / (6 / 1000))`: 171. This is
rounded to 170 for simplicity.

Benchmarking system:

- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz (4 cores, 8 threads)
- RAM: 32GB DDR4 2133 MHz

Each machine is different, we know that. But the above target helps us in multiple ways:

1. Develop an intuition what it means to burn X gas or how much gas can be used if a block should be
   executable in e.g. 1 second
2. Have a target for adjustments, e.g. when the Wasm runtime becomes faster or slower
3. Allow pricing of calls that are not executed in Wasm, such as crypto APIs
4. Find significant over or underpricing

## Gas overflow potential

CosmWasm gas aims for 1 Teragas/second, i.e. the uint64 range exceeds after 18 million seconds (5000
hours)<sup>1</sup>. Assuming a max supported block execution time of 30 seconds, the gas price has
to be over-priced by a factor of 614891 (614891 Teragas/second) in order to exceed the uint64
range<sup>2</sup>. Since serious over or underpricing is considered a bug, using uint64 for gas
measurements is considered safe.

Cosmos SDK gas uses values that are smaller by a factor of 150, so those don't overflow as well.
Since no Cosmos SDK gas values are processed inside of this repository, this is not our main
concern. However, it's good to know that we can safely pass them in uint64 fields, as long as the
full range is supported. This is the case for the C API as well as [JSON numbers] as long as both
sides support integers in their JSON implementation. Go and Rust do that while many other
implementations don't support integers, and convert them to IEEE-754 doubles, which has a safe
integer range up to about 53 bit (e.g. JavaScript and jq).

<sup>1</sup> `(2^64-1) / 10^12`

<sup>2</sup> `((2^64-1)/30) / 10^12`

    <summary>CosmWasm 1.x -> 2.0 changes</summary>

    In all versions before 2.0, the gas values were bigger by a factor of 1000.
    There is no need to have them this big and in order to reduce the risk of
    overflow, the gas values were lowered in [#1599]. Here is a breakdown of what
    this change entails:

    |                            | CosmWasm 1.x          | CosmWasm 2.x          |
    | -------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
    | Cost target                | 1 Teragas/millisecond | 1 Teragas/second      |
    | Exceeds uint64 range after | 5 hours               | 5124 hours (213 days) |
    | Cost per Wasm op           | 150_000               | 150                   |
    | Multiplier                 | 140_000_000           | 140_000               |
