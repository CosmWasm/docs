# Smart contract

The following sections describe how to create the example smart contract, which manages a
**counter** that can be initialized, incremented, decremented, and queried. Later on, you will
[write tests](writing-tests.mdx) for this contract using **`MultiTest`**.

<Callout type="info" emoji="â˜‰">
  The example smart contract presented in this chapter is a simplified version of the contract
  created based on the [cw&#8209;template](/core/installation#setting-up-the-contract).
</Callout>

## Creating the project

Smart contracts written in Rust are developed as Rust libraries, so let's first create a Rust
library named **counter**.

Change the working directory to your home directory:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cd ~
```

Create a dedicated directory to store your example smart contract:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
mkdir my-contracts
```

Change the working directory to `my-contracts`:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cd my-contracts
```

Create a new Rust library named **counter**:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo init --lib counter
```

Change the working directory to `counter`:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cd counter
```

Newly created library contains the **Cargo.toml** file and **lib.rs** file in `src` directory...

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
tree
```

...so the expected content of the `counter` directory is:

```ansi filename="counter (directory)"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€Â Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€Â [34;1msrc[0m
Â Â Â Â â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
```

By convention, the source code of the smart contract is placed in the file named **contract.rs**,
and the messages processed by the contract are usually placed in file named **msg.rs**. Both files
should be saved in `src` directory.

Let's create an empty **contract.rs** file...

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
touch src/contract.rs
```

...and empty **msg.rs** file:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
touch src/msg.rs
```

The final structure of the smart contract project placed in `counter` directory should look like
shown below:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
tree
```

```ansi filename="counter (directory)"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€Â Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€Â [34;1msrc[0m
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€â”€ contract.rs
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
Â Â Â Â â””â”€â”€ msg.rs
```

## Filling the content

In the [previous section](#creating-the-project) we have created a project structure for **counter**
smart contract, but the source files are still empty. In the following chapters, we provide examples
of different smart contract implementations.

Whether you're interested in developing smart contracts using pure CosmWasm or exploring the Sylvia
framework, the provided examples will guide you through the essential content of smart contract.
