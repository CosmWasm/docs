# P256 (secp256r1)

P256 is one of NIST's prime-order elliptic curves. You may need this curve to
implement protocols such as WebAuthn. This is the main reason this curve was
added to CosmWasm.

## Example

## Signature verification

<Callout>TODO: Add example as soon as secp256r1 is properly released</Callout>
