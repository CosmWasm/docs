# Query

In the previous section we talked about the [`execute` endpoint]. The `query`
endpoint is actually pretty similar to its sibling `execute`, but with one key
difference: The storage is only accessible immutably.

This means you can only _read_ from the storage but not _write_ to it.

## Definition

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(
    _deps: Deps,
    _env: Env,
    _msg: QueryMsg,
) -> StdResult<QueryResponse> {
  Ok(QueryResponse::default())
}
```

[`execute` endpoint]: ./execute.mdx
