# Blocks

There are several cases when testing CosmWasm smart contracts requires simulating delays on the
blockchain, like:

- staking and unstaking processes,
- governance voting periods,
- validator set changes,
- token vesting schedules,
- incentive distribution, or
- IBC packet timeouts.

## Operations on blocks

**`MultiTest`** provides several operations to initialize and update current block properties, such
as height and timestamp, in order to test delays on the blockchain.

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨">
  Although it is possible to modify **only** the height or **only** the timestamp of the block in
  **`MultiTest`**, this is not feasible in a real-life blockchain and may lead to unpredictable test
  results that do not reflect the blockchain's real-life behavior.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="â˜‰">
  Always increment the height **and** the timestamp of the block in tests.
</Callout>

In the following chapters, you will find practical examples of several operations on blocks, such as
block initialization and generating a new block.

## Initialization with the default block

In **`MultiTest`**, the chain is initialized with a default block that has the following properties:

- `height{:rust}`: **12345**,
- `time{:rust}`: **1571797419879305533** (Wed Oct 23 2019 02:23:39 GMT+0000),
- `chain_id{:rust}`: **cosmos-testnet-14002**.

These properties constitute the [`BlockInfo{:rust}`][BlockInfo] structure, which is defined in the
CosmWasm library for representing block metadata. [`BlockInfo{:rust}`][BlockInfo] can be retrieved
at any point in a test by calling the [`block_info{:rust}`][block_info] method provided by
`App{:rust}`.

The following example illustrates this case in detail.

```rust {4, 7} showLineNumbers copy /block_info/ /assert_eq!(12345/ /assert_eq!(1571797419879305533/ /assert_eq!("cosmos-testnet-14002"/
use cw_multi_test::App;

// create the default chain simulator
let app = App::default();

// get the initial block properties
let block = app.block_info();

// default block height is 12345
assert_eq!(12345, block.height);

// default block timestamp is Wed Oct 23 2019 02:23:39 GMT+0000
assert_eq!(1571797419879305533, block.time.nanos());

// default chain identifier is "cosmos-testnet-14002"
assert_eq!("cosmos-testnet-14002", block.chain_id);
```

In line 4, the chain is initialized and _started_ with the default settings by calling the function
[`default{:rust}`][app_default] on `App{:rust}`. In line 7, the current block metadata (of type
[`BlockInfo{:rust}`][BlockInfo]) is retrieved and assigned to variable `block{:rust}`. In the next
few lines, the default values are checked:

- line 10: block `height{:rust}` is `12345{:rust}`,
- line 13: block `time{:rust}` is a Unix timestamp of value `1571797419879305533{:rust}`, which is
  the numeric representation of `Wednesday, October 23, 2019 02:23:39 GMT`,
- line 16: block `chain_id{:rust}` has a default value `"cosmos-testnet-14002"{:rust}`.

## Initialization with the custom block

Although the chain initialization with the default block may be suitable for most test cases, it is
possible to initialize the chain with a custom [`BlockInfo{:rust}`][BlockInfo] using the
[`set_block{:rust}`][set_block] method provided by `App{:rust}`. The following example explains this
case in detail.

```rust showLineNumbers copy {8-12} /set_block/ /BlockInfo/
use cosmwasm_std::{BlockInfo, Timestamp};
use cw_multi_test::App;

// create the default chain simulator
let mut app = App::default();

// create and use a custom block
app.set_block(BlockInfo {
    height: 1,
    time: Timestamp::from_seconds(1723627489),
    chain_id: "starship-testnet".to_string(),
});

// get the custom block properties
let block = app.block_info();

// now the block height is 1
assert_eq!(1, block.height);

// now the block timestamp is Wed Aug 14 2024 09:24:49 GMT+0000
assert_eq!(1723627489, block.time.seconds());

// now the chain identifier is "starship-testnet"
assert_eq!("starship-testnet", block.chain_id);
```

The chain is started with the default settings in line 5. Then in line 8, the
[`set_block{:rust}`][set_block] method is called with custom block properties provided as
[`BlockInfo{:rust}`][BlockInfo] structure. The current block metadata is retrieved in line 12 and in
the next few lines the detailed values are checked:

- line 18: block `height{:rust}` is now `1{:rust}`,
- line 21: new block `time{:rust}` is a Unix timestamp of value `1723627489{:rust}`, which is the
  numeric representation (in seconds) of `Wednesday, August 14, 2024 09:24:49 GMT`,
- line 24: block `chain_id{:rust}` has now a value `"starship-testnet"{:rust}`.

This way, you can initialize the current block in tests to best suit your requirements.

<Callout type="info" emoji="â˜‰">
  You can also initialize the blockchain simulator with the custom block using [AppBuilder], as
  shown in this [example](app-builder#with_block).
</Callout>

## Generating next block with the default step

To generate a new block in tests, you can use the [`update_block{:rust}`][update_block] method
provided by `App{:rust}`. In the following example, [`update_block{:rust}`][update_block] method
takes a function [`next_block{:rust}`][next_block] as an argument. [`next_block{:rust}`][next_block]
function - provided by **`MultiTest`** - increases the block height by `1` and advances the block
time by `5` seconds, simulating the generation of a new block every `5` seconds in a real-life
blockchain. The `chain_id{:rust}` remains unchanged.

```rust showLineNumbers copy {7} /update_block/ /next_block/
use cw_multi_test::{next_block, App};

// create the default chain simulator
let mut app = App::default();

// update the block by `generating` next block
app.update_block(next_block);

// get the current block properties
let block = app.block_info();

// now the block height is 1 after the initial value
assert_eq!(12346, block.height);

// now the block timestamp is 5 seconds after the initial value
// current value is:   Wed Oct 23 2019 02:23:44 GMT+0000
// initial value was:  Wed Oct 23 2019 02:23:39 GMT+0000
assert_eq!(1571797424879305533, block.time.nanos());

// chain identifier remains unchanged
assert_eq!("cosmos-testnet-14002", block.chain_id);
```

In line 7 the [`update_block{:rust}`][update_block] method is called and in the next few lines the
current block properties are checked. In line 10 the block metadata is retrieved and assigned to
variable `block{:rust}`. In line 13, we check if the block height has changed. The default block
height is `12345{:rust}`, and we check it against the value `12346{:rust}`. As this assertion
passes, you can see that the block height was indeed incremented by `1`. Similarly, the block's time
is checked against the Unix timestamp, which is 5 seconds later than the default value:
`1571797424879305533{:rust}` - `1571797419879305533{:rust}` = `5000000000{:rust}` = 5 seconds.

## Generating next block with the custom step

Several events on the blockchain occur after a period longer than a few seconds. In such cases,
incrementing the block time multiple times until the desired time is reached would be impractical.
In **`MultiTest`**, it is possible to advance the block using a specific block height and time. To
achieve this, pass a custom closure to the [`update_block{:rust}`][update_block] method. This
closure takes a mutable [`BlockInfo{:rust}`][BlockInfo] structure as an argument and modifies its
properties, as shown in the example below.

```rust showLineNumbers copy {7-10} /update_block/
use cw_multi_test::App;

// create the default chain simulator
let mut app = App::default();

// 'generate' custom block
app.update_block(|block| {
    block.time = block.time.plus_days(6);
    block.height += 10000;
});

// get the block properties after updating
let block = app.block_info();

// now the block height is 10000 after the initial value
assert_eq!(22345, block.height);

// now the block timestamp is 6 days after the initial value
// current value is:   Wed Oct 23 2019 02:23:44 GMT+0000
// initial value was:  Tue Oct 29 2019 02:23:39 GMT+0000
assert_eq!(1572315819879305533, block.time.nanos());

// chain identifier remains unchanged
assert_eq!("cosmos-testnet-14002", block.chain_id);
```

In line 4, the default block is initialized during the chain start. Then in line 7, the
[`update_block{:rust}`][update_block] method takes a custom closure as an argument. This closure
increments the block height by **10000** and advances the block time by **6 days**. Similarly like
in prevous examples, the new block metadata is retrieved and the current properties are checked. The
new block height should be `12345{:rust}` + `10000{:rust}` = `22345{:rust}`. The new block time
should be `1572315819879305533{:rust}` -`1571797419879305533{:rust}` = `518400000000000{:rust}` =
518400 seconds = 8640 minutes = 144 hours = **6 days**. The chain identifier remains unchanged.
