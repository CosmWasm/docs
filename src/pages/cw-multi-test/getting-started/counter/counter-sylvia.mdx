# Counter written in Sylvia

## Counter source code

The following code snippets present the content of [**Cargo.toml**](#cargotoml),
[**lib.rs**](#librs), [**msg.rs**](#msgrs), and [**contract.rs**](#contractrs) files, respectively.
YouÂ can just copy and paste the provided content to previously created empty files, temporarily
skipping the detailed explanations. However, if you're curious about what happens inside each file,
feel free to check the detailed explanations provided for each code snippet.

### `Cargo.toml`

```toml showLineNumbers filename="Cargo.toml" copy
[package]
name = "counter"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[features]
# use library feature to disable all instantiate/execute/query exports
library = []

[dependencies]
cosmwasm-schema = "2"
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2" }
cw-storage-plus = "2"
schemars = "0.8"
serde = "1.0"
sylvia = { version = "1" }

[dev-dependencies]
sylvia = { version = "1", features = ["mt"] }
```

`Cargo.toml` is the configuration file for a Rust project â€” in our case, for a smart contract
written using Rust and the Sylvia framework. Below is a detailed explanation of each section and its
purpose.

**\[package\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{1} filename="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "counter"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

- **`[package]`** section provides metadata about the Rust crate (smart contract library in our
  case).
- **`name = "counter"`** specifies the name of the crate, it's named **counter** like our smart
  contract.
- **`version = "0.1.0"`** indicates the current version of the package and the counter smart
  contract.
- **`edition = "2021"`** specifies the Rust edition being used; editions in Rust are sets of
  language and compiler improvements, with 2021 being one of the latest editions at the time,
  providing the latest features and enhancements.

**\[lib\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{8} filename="Cargo.toml"
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
```

- **`[lib]`** section specifies settings for building the library.
- **`crate-type`** enumerates types of libraries to be produced during compiling.
- **`"cdylib"`** specifies that the package will be compiled as a C-compatible dynamic library;
  which is required for smart contracts to run on the CosmWasm runtime.
- **`"rlib"`** specifies a Rust library file that can be used as a dependency for other Rust
  projects, in our case for other smart contracts.

**\[features\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{11} filename="Cargo.toml"
[features]
# use library feature to disable all instantiate/execute/query exports
library = []
```

- **`[features]`** section defines optional features for the Rust package.
- **`library = []`** defines a feature named **library**, which when set, disables exporting smart
  contract entry-points. Exporting entry points is necessary for interacting with the smart contract
  on the blockchain. However, when the contract is used as a dependency by other contracts,
  exporting these entry-points should be disabled to prevent unintended function name clashes.

**\[dependencies\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{15} filename="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
cosmwasm-schema = "2"
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2" }
cw-storage-plus = "2"
schemars = "0.8"
serde = "1.0"
sylvia = { version = "1" }
```

- **`[dependencies]`** section lists the libraries that the package depends on.
- **`cosmwasm-schema`** is used for generating JSON schemas from Rust data structures, which is
  useful for documentation and ensuring compatibility of messages and queries.
- **`cosmwasm-std`** is the standard library for CosmWasm contracts, providing common types and
  utilities needed for interacting with the CosmWasm runtime.
- **`cw-storage-plus`** is a library that provides advanced storage abstractions and utilities on
  top of the basic storage capabilities in CosmWasm, making it easier to manage state within
  contracts.
- **`schemars`** is a library for generating JSON schemas, which complements `cosmwasm-schema` by
  providing additional features for schema generation.
- **`serde`** is a widely used serialization library in Rust, allowing easy conversion of Rust data
  structures to and from formats like JSON, which is crucial for data interchange in smart
  contracts.
- **`sylvia`** the Sylvia framework itself, needed to implement the smart contract.

**\[dev-dependencies\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{23} filename="Cargo.toml"
[dev-dependencies]
sylvia = { version = "1", features = ["mt"] }
```

- **`[dev-dependencies]`** section lists dependencies that are only needed for development and
  testing.
- **`sylvia`** the Sylvia framework with features required for testing smart contracts using
  **`MultiTest`**. Feature `"mt"` in Sylvia should be used only in **[dev-dependencies]** section.

Overall, this `Cargo.toml` file configures a Rust project for a CosmWasm-based smart contract. It
sets up the basic package details, specifies how the contract should be compiled, defines
dependencies for core functionality and testing, and includes features to enable or disable certain
parts of the contract code. This setup ensures the contract can be developed, tested, and deployed
effectively on the blockchain within the CosmWasm ecosystem.

### `lib.rs`

```rust showLineNumbers filename="lib.rs" copy
pub mod contract;
pub mod msg;
```

The `lib.rs` file in a Rust project serves as the main entry point for defining the structure of a
library. In the context of our example **counter** smart contract, the `lib.rs` file is defining and
organizing the modules that make up the contract. Recall the **counter** project file structure:

```ansi {4,6} filename="counter (directory)"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ [34;1msrc[0m
    â”œâ”€â”€ contract.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
    â””â”€â”€ msg.rs
```

There are two modules in the project: `contract.rs` and `msg.rs`. That's why in the `lib.rs` file
there are two declarations:

- `pub mod contract;{:rust}`<br/> This line declares a public module named **contract**; tells Rust
  to include the code from a file named `contract.rs` located in the same directory and makes the
  module publicly accessible (`pub` keyword), which means that other modules or external code can
  access the entry-points of our smart contract.
- `pub mod msg;{:rust}`<br/> This line declares a public module named **msg**; includes the code
  from a file named `msg.rs` and also makes this module public which allows other parts of the code
  (especially our **counter** smart contract) to access the messages defined here.

Overall, this `lib.rs` file is setting up the main structure of the smart contract by defining its
key components as separate modules. This organization helps in keeping the code clean, modular, and
maintainable by separating the core contract logic (`contract.rs`) from the message and query
definitions (`msg.rs`). This modular approach makes the smart contract easier to understand, extend,
and test.

### `msg.rs`

The **msg** module in file `msg.rs` typically defines responses returned by the contract queries. It
is also a convenient place to put any types that might be used by the smart contract. In our example
this includes messages shown below.

```rust showLineNumbers filename="msg.rs" copy
use cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde;

#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterInitMsg {
    Zero,
    Set(u8),
}

#[cw_serde]
pub struct CounterResponse {
    pub value: u8,
}
```

Let's take a detailed look at the implementation of messages.

**Imports**

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="msg.rs"
use cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde;
```

Required imports, like `cw_serde` annotation.

**Instantiation message**

This message is passed to `instantiate` entry-point.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{3} filename="msg.rs (CounterInitMsg)"
#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterInitMsg {
    Zero,
    Set(u8),
}
```

**`CounterInitMsg{:rust}`** enumeration is used to initialize the contract.
`CounterInitMsg::Zero{:rust}` variant initializes the counter with the zero value, and
`CounterInitMsg::Set{:rust}` variant initializes the counter with an arbitrary value in range 0
to 255. This message is passed to `instantiate{:rust}` entry-point of the counter smart contract.

**Response message**

This message is returned from `query` entry-point and passed to the user.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{9} filename="msg.rs (CounterResponse)"
#[cw_serde]
pub struct CounterResponse {
    pub value: u8,
}
```

**`CounterResponse{:rust}`** struct with a single field `value{:rust}`, used to pass the responses
(results) from the queries.

<Callout>
  Designing smart contracts using the Sylvia framework, we do not have to define messages passed to
  contracts entry-points ourselves. Sylvia generates them automatically based on the methods marked
  with the `#[sv::msg(...)]` attributes.
</Callout>

### `contract.rs`

Typically, in a smart contract project, the **contract** module (placed in the `contract.rs` file)
contains the core logic of the contract, including functions (entry-points) for instantiation,
execution, querying and migrating. This is where the main functionality of the smart contract is
implemented. And this is also the case for our **counter** smart contract. The full source code is
shown below.

```rust showLineNumbers filename="contract.rs" copy
use crate::msg::{CounterInitMsg, CounterResponse};
use cosmwasm_std::{Response, StdResult};
use cw_storage_plus::Item;
use sylvia::contract;
use sylvia::ctx::{ExecCtx, InstantiateCtx, QueryCtx};

pub struct CounterContract {
    pub count: Item<u8>,
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), sylvia::entry_points)]
#[contract]
impl CounterContract {
    pub const fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            count: Item::new("count"),
        }
    }

    #[sv::msg(instantiate)]
    fn init(&self, ctx: InstantiateCtx, msg: CounterInitMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
        match msg {
            CounterInitMsg::Zero => self.count.save(ctx.deps.storage, &0)?,
            CounterInitMsg::Set(value) => self.count.save(ctx.deps.storage, &value)?,
        }
        Ok(Response::new())
    }

    #[sv::msg(exec)]
    fn inc(&self, ctx: ExecCtx) -> StdResult<Response> {
        self.count
            .update(ctx.deps.storage, |count| -> StdResult<u8> {
                Ok(count.saturating_add(1))
            })?;
        Ok(Response::new())
    }

    #[sv::msg(exec)]
    fn dec(&self, ctx: ExecCtx) -> StdResult<Response> {
        self.count
            .update(ctx.deps.storage, |count| -> StdResult<u8> {
                Ok(count.saturating_sub(1))
            })?;
        Ok(Response::new())
    }

    #[sv::msg(exec)]
    fn set(&self, ctx: ExecCtx, value: u8) -> StdResult<Response> {
        self.count.save(ctx.deps.storage, &value)?;
        Ok(Response::new())
    }

    #[sv::msg(query)]
    fn value(&self, ctx: QueryCtx) -> StdResult<CounterResponse> {
        let value = self.count.load(ctx.deps.storage)?;
        Ok(CounterResponse { value })
    }
}
```

Let's take a detailed look at this implementation using Sylvia framework.

#### imports

```rust copy showLineNumbers{1} filename="contract.rs"
use crate::msg::{CounterInitMsg, CounterResponse};
use cosmwasm_std::{Response, StdResult};
use cw_storage_plus::Item;
use sylvia::contract;
use sylvia::ctx::{ExecCtx, InstantiateCtx, QueryCtx};
```

The first `use{:rust}` statement imports message structures for handling initialization of the
contract, and responses from queries. The second `use{:rust}` imports essential types from the
CosmWasm standard library. The third `use{:rust}` brings in the `Item{:rust}` type, which is needed
for storing single values in the contractâ€™s persistent storage. The last two `use{:rust}` statements
import Sylvia types and components essential to build a contract.

#### contract struct

```rust copy showLineNumbers{7} filename="contract.rs"
pub struct CounterContract {
    pub count: Item<u8>,
}
```

The `CounterContract{:rust}` is a public structure that represents a counter smart contract. It
contains one public field `count{:rust}`, which is of type `Item{:rust}` and serves as a "variable"
for tracking a value that can be incremented, decremented, queried, or reset by the smart contract.
More details about the [Item](../../../cw-storage-plus/containers/item) type can be found in
[cw-storage-plus](../../../cw-storage-plus) documentation. This field stores an 8-bit unsigned
integer representing a counter value.

More detailed explanation of the smart contract structure written in Sylvia can be found in
[Sylvia documentation](../../../sylvia/basics/contract-structure), but for testing purposes we will
just mention the key elements of this contract.

#### constructor

```rust copy showLineNumbers{14} filename="contract.rs"
    pub const fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            count: Item::new("count"),
        }
    }
```

Creates a new instance of the contract and binds the `count{:rust}` variable with the key
`"count"{:rust}` in the contract's persistent storage.

#### `instantiate` entry-point

The `init{:rust}` function, annotated as `#[sv::msg(instantiate)]{:rust}` is called during the
instantiation of the smart contract. Depending on the message passed in `msg{:rust}` argument, the
counter will be initialized with zero or with the value provided in `CounterInitMsg::Set{:rust}`
variant. Using the `self.count{:rust}` variable, the initial value is saved in the contract's
persistent storage.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{20} filename="contract.rs"
    #[sv::msg(instantiate)]
    fn init(&self, ctx: InstantiateCtx, msg: CounterInitMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
        match msg {
            CounterInitMsg::Zero => self.count.save(ctx.deps.storage, &0)?,
            CounterInitMsg::Set(value) => self.count.save(ctx.deps.storage, &value)?,
        }
        Ok(Response::new())
    }
```

#### `inc` variant of `execute` entry-point

The `inc{:rust}` function, annotated as `#[sv::msg(exec)]` is called during evaluation of the
`execute` entrypoint of the smart contract for the `"inc":{}` message variant. It increments the
counter by one and stores the new value in the contract's persistent storage, utilizing
`update{:rust}` function of the `self.count{:rust}` variable.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{29} filename="contract.rs"
    #[sv::msg(exec)]
    fn inc(&self, ctx: ExecCtx) -> StdResult<Response> {
        self.count
            .update(ctx.deps.storage, |count| -> StdResult<u8> {
                Ok(count.saturating_add(1))
            })?;
        Ok(Response::new())
    }
```

#### `dec` variant of `execute` entry-point

The `dec{:rust}` function, annotated as `#[sv::msg(exec)]` is called during evaluation of the
`execute` entrypoint of the smart contract for the `"dec":{}` message variant. It decrements the
counter by one and stores the new value in the contract's persistent storage, utilizing
`update{:rust}` function of the `self.count{:rust}` variable, similarly like `inc{:rust}` function.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{38} filename="contract.rs"
    #[sv::msg(exec)]
    fn dec(&self, ctx: ExecCtx) -> StdResult<Response> {
        self.count
            .update(ctx.deps.storage, |count| -> StdResult<u8> {
                Ok(count.saturating_sub(1))
            })?;
        Ok(Response::new())
    }
```

#### `set` variant of `execute` entry-point

The `set{:rust}` function, also annotated as `#[sv::msg(exec)]` is called during evaluation of the
`execute` entrypoint of the smart contract for the `"set":{"value":N}` message variant. It resets
the counter value and stores the new value in the contract's persistent storage, utilizing
`save{:rust}` function of the `self.count{:rust}` variable.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{47} filename="contract.rs"
    #[sv::msg(exec)]
    fn set(&self, ctx: ExecCtx, value: u8) -> StdResult<Response> {
        self.count.save(ctx.deps.storage, &value)?;
        Ok(Response::new())
    }
```

#### `query` entry-point

The `value{:rust}` function, annotated as `#[sv::msg(query)]` is called during querying the value of
the counter contract. The current value is retrieved from the contract's persistent storage, wrapped
in `CounterResponse{:rust}` message and returned to the calling user.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{53} filename="contract.rs"
    #[sv::msg(query)]
    fn value(&self, ctx: QueryCtx) -> StdResult<CounterResponse> {
        let value = self.count.load(ctx.deps.storage)?;
        Ok(CounterResponse { value })
    }
```

## What next?

Having the **counter** smart contract prepared, you can begin writing tests using **`MultiTest`**,
or you might want to check the pure CosmWasm version of the **counter** smart contract first.
