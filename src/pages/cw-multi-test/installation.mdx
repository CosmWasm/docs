# Installation

**`MultiTest`** ships as a Rust library named [cw-multi-test].

To use **`MultiTest`** for testing smart contracts, add it as a **DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCY** to your
project:

```toml filename="Cargo.toml" copy
[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = "2"
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨">
  **`MultiTest`** is a **TESTING** library and should always be added to your project as
  **DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCY** in section **`[dev-dependencies]`** of the **Cargo.toml** file.
</Callout>

## Prerequisities

The only prerequisite to test smart contracts using **`MultiTest`** is having [Rust and Cargo]
installed.

<Callout>
  We recommend installing Rust using the official [rustup installer]. This makes it easy to stay on
  the most recent Rust version.
</Callout>

Optionally, you may want to install [Tarpaulin] for measuring code coverage and [Nextest] for
running tests faster, with clean and beautiful user interface.

Installing **Tarpaulin**:

```shell copy
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

Installing **Nextest**:

```shell copy
cargo install cargo-nextest
```
