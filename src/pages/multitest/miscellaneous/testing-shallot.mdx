  Elaborate more about this idea, especially in the context of testing smart
  contracts.

## Test placement

### Unit tests placed directly in a smart contract source file

<Callout emoji="🎯" type="info">
  **Testing the private functionality of the smart contract.**
</Callout>

Non-trivial smart contracts implement required _public_ entry points, as well as
multiple functions that are used internally within these entry points. Internal
functions like these are typically defined as _private_ within the smart
contract's source file, which means there is no direct way to test them from
outside of this file. By convention, such unit tests are placed in a separate
submodule named **tests** within the smart contract's source file.

**Examples**:

```rust
// Example of tests placed in submodule
```

### Unit tests placed in a separate module outside smart contract source file

<Callout emoji="🎯" type="info">
  Testing the functionality of module used by smart contract.
</Callout>

**Examples**:

```rust
// example of test functions placed in a separate module under `src` directory
```

### Integration tests placed in dedicated `tests` directory

<Callout emoji="🎯" type="info">
  Testing the public functionality (entry points) of a single smart contract.
</Callout>

**Examples**:

```rust
// example of such tests
```

### Interaction tests placed in a dedicated crate inside a workspace

<Callout emoji="🎯" type="info">
  Testing interactions among multiple smart contracts running on the same
  blockchain.
</Callout>

**Examples**:

```rust
// example of such crate
```

### Interoperability (communication) tests placed in ... ?

<Callout emoji="🎯" type="info">
  Testing interactions among multiple smart contracts running on multiple
  blockchains.
</Callout>

**Examples**:

```rust
// example of such crate
```
