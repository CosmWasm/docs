# Permissions

This section describes the permission settings, enabling you to manage access to essential
operations like uploading and instantiating WASM contracts.

## Chain Permissions

The `wasm` module provides configurable settings to control who can upload and instantiate WASM
binaries. These settings are managed through the Cosmos-SDK’s `params` module.

### Parameters

`"code_upload_access"`: This setting determines who is permitted to upload WASM binaries to the
blockchain.

- `Nobody`: Disables Wasm binary uploads for everyone.
- `Everybody`: Allows anyone to upload a Wasm binary.
- `AnyOfAddresses`: Restricts Wasm binary uploads to specific addresses.

`"instantiate_default_permission"`: This setting defines the default permission for who can
instantiate a WASM binary if the code owner has not explicitly set this permission.

- `Nobody`: No one is allowed to instantiate the WASM binary.
- `Everybody`: Any user on the blockchain can instantiate the WASM binary.
- `AnyOfAddresses`: Only the specified addresses can instantiate the WASM binary.

### Genesis File Configuration

During the initial setup of the blockchain, you can configure these parameters in the genesis file
as follows:

```json
    "wasm": {
      "params": {
        "code_upload_access": {
          "permission": "Everybody"
        },
        "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
      }
    },
```

### Updating Chain Permissions

After the chain has been initialized, you can update these parameters through a governance proposal
using the `MsgUpdateParams` message type. The `MsgUpdateParams` message type is used to propose
changes to the blockchain's configuration parameters via governance.

#### Drafting the Proposal

Use the interactive CLI tool to draft a governance proposal:

```sh
wasmd tx gov draft-proposal
```

#### Submitting the Proposal

Once the draft is prepared, submit the proposal using the following command:

```sh
wasmd tx gov submit-proposal draft_proposal.json  --from alice --keyring-backend=test --chain-id=docs-chain-1
```

### Example Scenarios

Below are a few examples demonstrating how to configure different scenarios for WASM code upload
permissions using governance proposals:

**Disable Wasm Code Uploads**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "@type": "/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgUpdateParams",
      "authority": "wasm10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700js7zslc",
      "params": {
        "code_upload_access": {
          "permission": "Nobody",
          "addresses": []
        },
        "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": "ipfs://CID",
  "deposit": "1000000stake",
  "title": "Disable Wasm Code Uploads",
  "summary": "This proposal disables the ability for anyone to upload new WASM binaries.",
  "expedited": false
}
```

**Allow WASM Code Uploads for Everybody**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "@type": "/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgUpdateParams",
      "authority": "wasm10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700js7zslc",
      "params": {
        "code_upload_access": {
          "permission": "Everybody",
          "addresses": []
        },
        "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": "ipfs://CID",
  "deposit": "1000000stake",
  "title": "Allow WASM code uploads for everybody",
  "summary": "This proposal enables the ability for anyone to upload new WASM binaries.",
  "expedited": false
}
```

**Restrict WASM Code Uploads to Specific Addresses**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "@type": "/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgUpdateParams",
      "authority": "wasm10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700js7zslc",
      "params": {
        "code_upload_access": {
          "permission": "AnyOfAddresses",
          "addresses": [
            "wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku",
            "wasm179avw96aay70ps99umuaesxxczwc0qm5gwufxg"
          ]
        },
        "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": "ipfs://CID",
  "deposit": "1000000stake",
  "title": "Allow WASM code uploads only for Alice and Bob",
  "summary": "This proposal enables the ability for Alice and Bob to upload new WASM binaries.",
  "expedited": false
}
```

### Query params

You can query the chain permissions using the following command:

```sh
wasmd q wasm params -o json
```

The output looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "code_upload_access": {
    "permission": "Everybody",
    "addresses": []
  },
  "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
}
```

## Contract Permissions

This section details how to grant and query permissions for storing, executing, and migrating WASM
contracts on the blockchain.

### Store Code Authorization

To authorize a specific address to store WASM code, use the following command:

```sh
wasmd tx wasm grant store-code \
    wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku \
    3F4CD47C39C57FE1733FB41ED176EEBD9D5C67BAF5DF8A1EEDA1455E758F8514:everybody \
    --from alice \
    --keyring-backend=test \
    --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
    -y
```

This command allows **Alice** to grant **Bob** (`wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku`) the
authorization to **store** a specific WASM code on the blockchain. The WASM code is defined by the
code checksum `3F4CD47C39C57FE1733FB41ED176EEBD9D5C67BAF5DF8A1EEDA1455E758F8514`. The permission
granted allows `"everybody"` to instantiate this code. This means that once **Bob** uploads the WASM
code, any user on the blockchain will be able to instantiate it.

You can verify the authorization by querying the grants:

```sh
wasmd q authz grants wasm179avw96aay70ps99umuaesxxczwc0qm5gwufxg wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku -o json
```

The output looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "grants": [
    {
      "authorization": {
        "type": "wasm/StoreCodeAuthorization",
        "value": {
          "grants": [
            {
              "code_hash": "M0Y0Q0Q0N0MzOUM1N0ZFMTczM0ZCNDFFRDE3NkVFQkQ5RDVDNjdCQUY1REY4QTFFRURBMTQ1NUU3NThGODUxNA==",
              "instantiate_permission": {}
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": "1"
  }
}
```

### Contract Execution Authorization

To authorize a specific address to execute a WASM contract, use the following command:

```sh
wasmd tx wasm grant contract \
    wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku execution \
    wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d \
    --allow-all-messages \
    --max-calls 1 \
    --no-token-transfer \
    --expiration 1755772189 \
    --from alice \
    --keyring-backend=test \
    --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
    -y
```

This command allows **Alice** to grant **Bob** (`wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku`) the
authorization to **execute** a specific WASM smart contract
(wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d). The granted permission allows
**Bob** to execute any message on the contract, but only for a single execution (`--max-calls 1`)
and does not allow token transfers (`--no-token-transfer`). This permission applies to all message
types (`--allow-all-messages`) and will expire at a specified timestamp (`--expiration 1755772189`).

The authorization can be verified by querying the grants:

```json
{
  "grants": [
    {
      "authorization": {
        "type": "wasm/ContractExecutionAuthorization",
        "value": {
          "grants": [
            {
              "contract": "wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d",
              "limit": {
                "type": "wasm/MaxCallsLimit",
                "value": {
                  "remaining": "1"
                }
              },
              "filter": {
                "type": "wasm/AllowAllMessagesFilter",
                "value": {}
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "expiration": "2025-08-21T10:29:49Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Contract Migration Authorization

To authorize a specific address to migrate a WASM contract, use the following command:

```sh
wasmd tx wasm grant contract wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku migration \
    wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d \
    --allow-all-messages \
    --max-calls 5 \
    --max-funds 100000stake \
    --expiration 1755772189 \
    --from alice \
    --keyring-backend=test \
    --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
    -y
```

This command allows **Alice** to grant **Bob** (`wasm1427kpq9mmnfp0madk5axh2ukmjgpfh6skzdxku`) the
authorization to **migrate** a specific WASM smart contract
(`wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d`). The granted permission allows
**Bob** to perform up to five migrations (`--max-calls 5`) with a maximum fund limit of 100,000
stake tokens (`--max-funds 100000stake`). This permission applies to all message types
(`--allow-all-messages`) and will expire at a specified timestamp (`--expiration 1755772189`).

The authorization can be verified by querying the grants:

```json
{
  "grants": [
    {
      "authorization": {
        "type": "wasm/ContractMigrationAuthorization",
        "value": {
          "grants": [
            {
              "contract": "wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d",
              "limit": {
                "type": "wasm/CombinedLimit",
                "value": {
                  "calls_remaining": "5",
                  "amounts": [
                    {
                      "denom": "stake",
                      "amount": "100000"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              },
              "filter": {
                "type": "wasm/AllowAllMessagesFilter",
                "value": {}
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "expiration": "2025-08-21T10:29:49Z"
    }
  ]
}
```
