# Communication helpers

Sylvia defines few types to ease the communication between contracts. By design, they are very
limited in their functionality and serve as an infrastructure. All of the message constructing
methods are meant to be provided via traits.

To gate these methods to be only accessible for the specific contracts, all of these types are
generic over a contract type.

<Callout>
  The goal of these helpers is to automate the message construction, making the code more readable
  and reducing risk of an error.
</Callout>

## Remote

The [`Remote`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.Remote.html) type is a gateway,
that stores the remote contract address and expose methods constructing the communication helpers.

These methods are:

- [`Remote::querier`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.Remote.html#method.querier) -
  returns the
  [`BoundQuerier<_, Contract>`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.BoundQuerier.html),
- [`Remote::executor`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.Remote.html#method.executor) -
  returns the
  [`ExecutorBuilder<(EmptyExecutorBuilderState, Contract)>`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.ExecutorBuilder.html).

<Callout>
  We recommend to store the `Remote` type as the contract state and access the `BoundQuerier` and
  `ExecutorBuilder` via above methods.
</Callout>

The `Remote` can be stored as a represantation of a specific contract:

```rust
pub struct Contract<'a> {
    remote: Item<Remote<'a, OtherContract>>,
}
```

we can also store a `Remote` to some contract implementing an interface:

```rust
pub struct Contract<'a> {
    remote: Remote<
        'a,
        dyn SomeInterface<
            Error = StdError,
            ExecC = ExampleMsg,
            QueryC = ExampleQuery,
            CounterT = CounterT,
        >,
    >,
}
```

<Callout>
  Note that we have to use the dynamic dispatch here and also provide values for every associated
  type defined in the interface.
</Callout>

The initialization of the `Remote` requires only the address of the external contract:

```rust
self.remote
    .save(ctx.deps.storage, &sylvia::types::Remote::new(remote_addr))?;
```

and in the usage you can access the `BoundQuerier` and the `ExecutorBuilder`.

```rust
let bound_querier = self
    .remote
    .load(ctx.deps.storage)?
    .querier(&ctx.deps.querier);

let executor_builder = self
    .remote
    .load(ctx.deps.storage)?
    .executor();
```

## BoundQuerier

The [`BoundQuerier`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.BoundQuerier.html) is a
wrapper over the
[`QuerierWrapper`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.QuerierWrapper.html).

We provide the querying functionality via traits. The [`contract`](../macros/contract) and
[`interface`](../macros/interface) macros generate these traits for us. You can learn about that in
[`this section`](../macros/generated-types/communication#query-helpers). If you don't use Sylvia
yet, you can create and implement those traits manually. Feel free to get inspiration from above
example.

With the traits implemented, a contract with a query method `some_query` can be queried as follows:

```rust
let some_response = self
    .remote
    .load(ctx.deps.storage)?
    .querier(&ctx.deps.querier)
    .count()?;
```

## ExecutorBuilder

The [`ExecutorBuilder`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.ExecutorBuilder.html) is
used to construct the
[`WasmMsg`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/enum.WasmMsg.html).

It's generic over two states limiting it's functionality depending on the stage it's in:

- [`EmptyExecutorBuilderState`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.EmptyExecutorBuilderState.html) -
  Setting funds for the transaction,
- [`ReadyExecutorBuilderState`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.ReadyExecutorBuilderState.html) -
  [`Building`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/types/struct.ExecutorBuilder.html#method.build)
  the `WasmMsg`.

For the `ExecutorBuilder` generic over `EmptyExecutorBuilderState`, we also provide the message
constructing functionality. The [`contract`](../macros/contract) and
[`interface`](../macros/interface) macros generate a trait with methods for every execute message.
You can learn about that in
[`this section`](../macros/generated-types/communication#execute-helpers). If you don't use Sylvia
yet, you can create and implement those traits manually. Feel free to get inspiration from above
example.

With the traits implemented, we can create an execute method `some_exec` can be queried as follows:

```rust
let wasm_msg = self
    .remote
    .load(ctx.deps.storage)?
    .executor()
    .some_exec()?
    .build();
```
