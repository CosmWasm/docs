# `sv::features` attribute

Use `sv::features` to enable Sylvia features that would be considered semver breaking between minor
releases.

## Macros

List of macros supporting the `sv::features` attribute:

- [`contract`](../contract)
- [`entry_points`](../entry-points)

## Usage

```rust {5}, template="sylvia-empty"
pub struct Contract;

#[cfg_attr(feature = "library", sylvia::entry_points)]
#[contract]
impl Contract {
    pub const fn new() -> Self {
        Self
    }

    #[sv::msg(instantiate)]
    fn instantiate(&self, ctx: InstantiateCtx) -> StdResult<Response> {
        Ok(Response::new())
    }

    #[sv::msg(reply, handlers=[remote_instantiated], reply_on=success)]
    fn store_remote_address(
        &self,
        ctx: ReplyCtx,
        #[sv::data(instantiate)] data: MsgInstantiateContractResponse,
        #[sv::payload(raw)] payload: Binary,
    ) -> StdResult<Response> {
        Ok(Response::new())
    }
}
```

<Callout>
  As of **Sylvia 2.0.0**, all features are stabilized, and currently there are no supported `sv::features` parameters.
