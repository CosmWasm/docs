# Contract creation

The easiest and recommended way to start working on a new CosmWasm contract is to generate it from
the [`cw-template`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template).

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo generate CosmWasm/cw-template
```

The [`cw-template`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template) will generate a lot of code for you.
Because this tutorial aims to guide you step-by-step through the process of creating your first
contract we will omit the use of the template and show you how to create it from the start.

## New project

As smart contracts are Rust library crates, we will start with creating one:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo new --lib ./contract
```

You created a simple Rust library, but it is not yet ready to be a smart contract. The first thing
to do is to update the Cargo.toml file:

```toml copy filename="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "contract"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2.1.4", features = ["staking"] }
```

As you can see, I added a `crate-type` field in the library section. Generating the `cdylib` is
required to create a proper web assembly binary. The downside of this is that such a library cannot
be used as a dependency for other Rust crates - for now, it is not needed, but later we will show
how to approach reusing contracts as dependencies.

Additionally, there is one core dependency for smart contracts: the
[`cosmwasm-std`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/). This crate is a standard
library for smart contracts. It provides essential utilities for communication with the outside
world and a couple of helper functions and types. Every smart contract we will build will use this
dependency.
