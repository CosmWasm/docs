# Instantiate2 algorithm

With the instantiate2 algorithm you can create a contract address in a predictable and deterministic
way. The underlying algorithm is rather simple.

We use SHA-256 as the underlying hashing algorithm.

You need to provide the following inputs:

- Checksum: This is the checksum of the contract code (the Wasm module, for example). This _has_ to
  be a SHA-256 hash
- Creator: This is the canonicalized address of the user instantiating the contract
- Salt: This is some byte string allowing you to distinguish multiple instantiations of the same
  contract by the same creator; this parameter has to be under 64 bytes in length
- Message: This is usually unused. CosmWasm sets this to an empty byte string

<Callout>
  Make sure you convert all the integers into their *big-endian* byte representation!
</Callout>

```rust filename="instantiate2.rs" template="instantiate-spec"
let c_checksum = concat!((checksum.len() as u64).to_be_bytes(), checksum);
let c_creator = concat!((creator.len() as u64).to_be_bytes(), creator);
let c_salt = concat!((salt.len() as u64).to_be_bytes(), salt);
let c_msg = concat!((msg.len() as u64).to_be_bytes(), msg);

let canonical_address = hash_sha256(
    concat!(
        hash_sha256(b"module"),
        b"wasm\0",
        c_checksum,
        c_creator,
        c_salt,
        c_msg,
    ),
);
```
