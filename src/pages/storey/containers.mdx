# Containers

A container is an abstraction that manages how some data should be stored and retrieved. Sometimes
this is as simple as a single value ([`Item`](containers/item)), sometimes there's more to it than
that.

For most of your needs, you can likely do what you need to with the built-in containers:

- [`Item`](containers/item)
- [`Map`](containers/map)
- [`Column`](containers/column)

For more advanced use cases, you can build your own containers as described in the
[_Implementing new containers_](container-impl) section.

## Namespace

To construct a container, you need to provide a single byte. This byte is used to distinguish
between different "root" containers in the same storage space.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storey::containers::{Item, Map};

let item: Item<u32> = Item::new(0); // byte 0 is used as the namespace
let map: Map<String, Item<u32>> = Map::new(1); // byte 1 is used as the namespace
```

A container will assume it's free to save stuff under the given key (e.g. `A`), and any key that
starts with that same byte (e.g. `A28F`). In this way, a whole namespace is reserved for the
container.

<Callout>
  An item will simply store its value under the given byte, while a map will store its values under
  keys that are prefixed with the given byte. How exactly the namespace is managed is up to the
  container implementation.
</Callout>

To avoid key collisions, you must provide a different byte to each container.

## Accessor

Every container has a corresponding "accessor" type that is used to perform all read/write
operations.

To get the accessor of a top-level container, the [`access` method] must be called. It takes a
reference to a storage backend.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storey::containers::Item;

let item: Item<u32> = Item::new(0);

item.access(&mut storage)
    .set(&42)
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    item.access(&storage)
        .get()
        .unwrap(),
    Some(42)
);
```

## Composition

Some containers can be composed together to create more complex data structures. Right now, the only
built-in container that supports composition is the `Map` container.

This is an alternative design largely used to achieve the same effect as "composite keys" in
`cw-storage-plus` (think tuple keys like `(String, u32)`), but also make this more flexible - you
can put a `Column` or any other container inside a `Map`!

Let's compare the two approaches:

<Tabs items={[`cw-storage-plus`, `storey`]} defaultIndex={0}> <Tabs.Tab>

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::Map;

let map: Map<(String, String), u32> = Map::new("m");

map.save(&mut storage, ("foo".to_string(), "bar".to_string()), &42)
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    map.load(&storage, ("foo".to_string(), "bar".to_string())),
    Ok(42)
);
```

</Tabs.Tab> <Tabs.Tab>

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storey::containers::{Map, Item};

let map: Map<String, Map<String, Item<u32>>> = Map::new(0);

map.access(&mut storage)
    .entry_mut("foo")
    .entry_mut("bar")
    .set(&42)
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    map.access(&storage)
        .entry("foo")
        .entry("bar")
        .get()
        .unwrap(),
    Some(42)
);
```

</Tabs.Tab></Tabs>

It's possible to define custom containers that enable composition similar to maps. If done properly,
they can be mixed with any other containers, including built-in ones.

## Encoding

Types like `Item` or `Column` need a way to encode values in a binary store. If you're using the
`Item` and `Column` types from `cw-storey`, the [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) format is used.
This is a binary encoding that should generally be a storage performance improvement over JSON.

If you need to use a different encoding, you can instead import the `Item`/`Column` type from the
`storey` crate and specify an alternative encoding. A guide to implementing your encoding can be
found in the [_Alternative encodings_](encodings) section.
