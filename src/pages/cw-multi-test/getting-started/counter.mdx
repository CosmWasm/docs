# Counter

The following sections describe how to create an example smart contract, which manages a **counter**
that can be `initialized`, `incremented`, `decremented`, and `queried`. Later on, we will
[write tests](writing-tests.mdx) for this smart contract using **`MultiTest`**.

<Callout type="info" emoji="â˜‰">
  The example **counter** smart contract presented in this chapter is a simplified version of the
  contract created based on the [cw&#8209;template](/core/installation#setting-up-the-contract).

## Counter specification

(todo: describe here the counter functionalities from "business point of view", just to make clear
what we implement)

## Creating counter project

Smart contracts written in Rust are developed as Rust libraries, so let's first create a Rust
library named **counter**.

Change the working directory to your home directory:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cd ~
```

Create a dedicated directory to store your example smart contract:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
mkdir my-contracts
```

Change the working directory to `my-contracts`:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cd my-contracts
```

Create a new Rust library named **counter**:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo init --lib counter
```

Change the working directory to `counter`:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cd counter
```

Newly created library contains the **Cargo.toml** file and **lib.rs** file in `src` directory...

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
tree
```

...so the expected structure of the `counter` directory is:

```ansi filename="counter (directory)"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€Â Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€Â [34;1msrc[0m
Â Â Â Â â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
```

By convention, the source code of the smart contract is placed in the file named **contract.rs**,
and the messages processed by this contract are usually placed in file named **msg.rs**. Both files
should be saved in `src` directory.

Let's create an empty **contract.rs** file...

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
touch src/contract.rs
```

...and empty **msg.rs** file:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
touch src/msg.rs
```

The final structure of the smart contract project placed in the `counter` directory should look like
this:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
tree
```

```ansi filename="counter (directory)"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€Â Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€Â [34;1msrc[0m
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€â”€ contract.rs
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
Â Â Â Â â””â”€â”€ msg.rs
```

## Filling the content

In the previous section we have created a project structure for **counter** smart contract, but the
source files are still emptyÂ ðŸ—‹Â . In the following chapters, we provide examples of two different
implementations of the **counter** smart contract: using the pure CosmWasm libraries, and using the
Sylvia framework.

Whether you're interested in developing smart contracts using CosmWasm libraries or exploring the
Sylvia framework, the following examples will guide you through the essential content of smart
contract, in our case, theÂ **counter**.
