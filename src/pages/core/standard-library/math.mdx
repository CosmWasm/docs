# Math

CosmWasm offers mathematical primitives for, you guessed it, mathematical operations. In contrast to
the Rust standard library, which is limited to 128 bit integers, we offer [integers] that exceed
that precision. Also [decimals] for fixed point math are available.

## Conversions

The following overview shows how to convert between integers and decimals of different size. This
only shows the unsigned case but the signed types work the same way.

![Integer decimal conversions overview](/diagrams/integer-decimal-conversions.png)

`From`/`TryFrom` refer to the
[Rust trait implementations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/conversion/from_into.html).
`::to_*` are functions on the source type and `::new`/`::from_*` are functions on the destination
type.

[integers]: ./math/integers
[decimals]: ./math/decimals
