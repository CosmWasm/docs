# Packet lifecycle

In this section, we will cover the lifecycle of a packet in the IBC protocol.
Sending and receiving packets is the core functionality of IBC, and it is
important to understand how packets are processed and what implications this has
for your protocol.

There are two flows that a packet can take during its lifecycle. Both start with
a packet being sent on chain A. The first flow is the successful delivery of the
packet to chain B:

1. **Sending a packet**: A packet is sent from chain A through a channel.
2. **Receiving a packet**: The packet is received and acknowledged by chain B.
3. **Receiving a packet acknowledgement**: Chain A receives the acknowledgement.

The second flow is when the packet is not relayed to chain B within the
specified time frame:

1. **Sending a packet**: A packet is sent from chain A through a channel.
2. **Receiving a packet timeout**: The packet is not received within the
   specified time frame.

A visual representation of these flows can be found in the
[IBC specification](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#packet-flow--handling).

## Sending a packet

In order to send a packet, you need to send the `IbcMsg::SendPacket` message. It
looks like this:

<Tabs items={['StoragePlus', 'Storey']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```rust template="ibc-packet"
use cw_storage_plus::Item;

const CHANNEL: Item<ChannelInfo> = Item::new("channel");

let channel_id = CHANNEL.load(deps.storage)?.channel_id;
// construct the transfer message
let msg = IbcMsg::SendPacket {
    channel_id,
    data: br#"{"hello":{"text":"Hello, chain B!"}}"#.into(),
    timeout: IbcTimeout::with_block(IbcTimeoutBlock {
        revision: 4,
        height: 1000,
    }),
};

// attach the message and return the response
Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```rust template="ibc-packet"
use cw_storey::{containers::Item, CwStorage};

const CHANNEL: Item<ChannelInfo> = Item::new(0);

let channel_id = CHANNEL
    .access(&mut CwStorage(deps.storage))
    .get()?
    .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("channel handshake hasn't started yet"))?
    .channel_id;
// construct the transfer message
let msg = IbcMsg::SendPacket {
    channel_id,
    data: br#"{"hello":{"text":"Hello, chain B!"}}"#.into(),
    timeout: IbcTimeout::with_block(IbcTimeoutBlock {
        revision: 4,
        height: 1000,
    }),
};

// attach the message and return the response
Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
The `channel_id` is the identifier of the channel you want to use for the
packet. This must be a channel that was previously established, as described in
the [previous section], so you probably want to load this from contract state.

The `data` field is of type `Binary` and contains the actual packet data. This
is the information that you want to send to chain B.

The `timeout` field can either be a timestamp or a block height, as measured on
the destination chain. It is used to prevent the packet from being stuck in
limbo if the destination chain does not receive it.

## Receiving a packet

To receive a packet, you need to implement the `ibc_packet_receive` entrypoint:

```rust filename="ibc.rs" template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_packet_receive(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    msg: IbcPacketReceiveMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcReceiveResponse> {
    let msg: PacketMsg = from_json(msg.packet.data)?;
    match msg {
        PacketMsg::Hello { text } => {
            // here you would do something with the received data
            deps.api.debug(&text);
            Ok(IbcReceiveResponse::new(StdAck::success(b"Hello, chain A!")))
        },
    }
}

#[cw_serde]
enum PacketMsg {
    Hello { text: String },
}
```

As you can see, this looks quite similar to the [`execute`] entrypoint. The main
difference is that you need to parse the packet data yourself, because it is not
necessarily in JSON format. What is also different, is the return type. Instead
of returning a `Response`, you need to return an [`IbcReceiveResponse`] with an
optional acknowledgement (see [next section](#async-acknowledgement) for more
details about not providing an acknowledgement).

In this example, we used the [`StdAck`] type for our acknowledgement. It encodes
the acknowledgement as a JSON object which can either be
`{"result":"BASE64 OF DATA"}` in the success case, or `{"error":"error string"}`
in the error case. This is the same format that is used in some existing IBC
protocols, like e.g. [ICS-20]. However, using this format is not a requirement.
You can use any type you like, as long as it can be converted to `Binary`.

### Error handling

Using a different acknowledgement format comes with a caveat, though: The error
handling for `ibc_packet_receive` works differently than for other entrypoints.

If you return an error from `ibc_packet_receive`, it will revert your contract
state changes, but will not fail the transaction. Instead, it will cause an
`StdAck::error` acknowledgement to be written. So, if you want to return errors
in `ibc_packet_receive`, you might want to also use the [`StdAck`] type for your
successful acknowledgements to keep the format consistent for the sender.

Alternatively, you can also handle all errors within the `ibc_packet_receive`
entrypoint, always returning an `Ok(...)` result. In that case, **state changes
will be committed**, the transaction will succeed and you can use whatever
acknowledgement format you prefer.

Panicking in `ibc_packet_receive` works the same as in other entrypoints: it
will revert all state changes and **fail** the transaction. One use case for
this is implementing a relayer allowlist because the failed receive can then be
picked up by another relayer.

### Async acknowledgement

<Callout type="warning">
  This feature is currently under development and will be available in a future
  version of CosmWasm.
</Callout>

In some cases, you might want to acknowledge a packet asynchronously. This means
that you receive the packet, but you don't immediately return an
acknowledgement. One case where this is useful is if you need to perform some
other action that requires more than one transaction to complete before you can
acknowledge. To do that, you can return a `IbcReceiveResponse::without_ack()`
response, save the destination channel ID and packet sequence in contract state,
and then acknowledge the packet later using the `IbcMsg::WriteAcknowledgement`
message.

<Callout type="warning">
  It is your responsibility to ensure that a received packet is always
  acknowledged at some point. Not acknowledging can lead to problems for the
  sender of the packet.
</Callout>

{/* TODO: add `template="core"` once async acks are merged */}

```rust filename="ibc.rs"
use cw_storage_plus::Map;

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_packet_receive(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    msg: IbcPacketReceiveMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcReceiveResponse> {
    // save the data we need for the async acknowledgement in contract state
    // note: we are just saving a String here, but you can save any information
    // you need for the acknowledgement later
    ACK_LATER.save(
        deps.storage,
        &(msg.packet.sequence, msg.packet.dest.channel_id),
        &"ack str".to_string(),
    )?;

    // return without an acknowledgement
    Ok(IbcReceiveResponse::without_ack())
}

/// Called somewhere in the contract to acknowledge the packet
pub fn async_ack(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    packet_sequence: u64,
    channel_id: String,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // load data from contract state
    let ack_str = ACK_LATER.load(deps.storage, &(packet_sequence, channel_id.clone()))?;

    // send the acknowledgement
    Ok(Response::new().add_message(IbcMsg::WriteAcknowledgement {
        packet_sequence,
        channel_id,
        data: StdAck::success(ack_str.as_bytes()).into(),
    }))
}

const ACK_LATER: Map<&(u64, String), String> = Map::new("ack_later");
```

## Receiving a packet acknowledgement

After the packet has been received and acknowledged by chain B, the relayer will
pass the acknowledgement back to chain A, resulting in the `ibc_packet_ack`
entrypoint being called. This is where you can handle the acknowledgement:

```rust filename="ibc.rs" template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_packet_ack(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    msg: IbcPacketAckMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    // this example assumes that the acknowledgement is an StdAck
    let ack: StdAck = from_json(&msg.acknowledgement.data)?;

    // here you can do something with the acknowledgement

    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::new())
}
```

The [`IbcPacketAckMsg`] struct contains the acknowledgement and original packet
data, as well as the address of the relayer that sent the acknowledgement.

When this entrypoint is called, it means that the packet has been successfully
delivered to chain B and has been processed by the counterparty. This is the
happy path of the packet lifecycle.

[`IbcPacketAckMsg`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.IbcPacketAckMsg.html

## Receiving a packet timeout

If the packet is not relayed to chain B within the specified time frame (e.g.
because the chain is stopped or no relayer is picking the packet up), a relayer
can call the `ibc_packet_timeout` entrypoint with a [`IbcPacketTimeoutMsg`].
This is where you can handle the timeout.

<Callout>
  Please note that a timeout happening on an ordered channel automatically
  closes the channel, since after a timeout the order of packets can no longer
  be guaranteed.
</Callout>

```rust filename="ibc.rs" template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_packet_timeout(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _msg: IbcPacketTimeoutMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::new())
}
```

When this entrypoint is called, it means that the packet has not been delivered
until the timeout specified when sending the packet. This is the unhappy path of
the packet lifecycle.

Note that the timeout is based on when the packet is _received_ on chain B,
_not_ on when it is _acknowledged_. This means that a packet that is received,
but not acknowledged will **not** trigger a timeout.

  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.IbcPacketTimeoutMsg.html

## State rewinding

As you can see, IBC is inherently non-atomic. In a single atomic transaction,
you can do all the changes you want and later return an error, which reverts the
whole transaction. In IBC, you send a packet in one transaction and receive the
acknowledgement or timeout in another transaction. This means that you have to
take care of undoing the changes yourself. This includes any state changes you
made when sending the packet, as well as any funds sent to you. You also need to
make sure that when you send the packet, you don't do anything that shouldn't
happen until the packet is acknowledged (like sending funds to someone else).

For state changes there are two main strategies:

- **Temporary state**: You can save the state changes you want to make in a
  special temporary storage container. If the packet is acknowledged, you can
  move them to the main storage to finalize them. If the packet times out, you
  can discard them.
- **Undoing state changes**: You can do the state changes when sending the
  packet and later undo them if the packet times out. It is important to make
  sure that you can actually undo the changes you made and that you cannot get
  into an inconsistent state by doing this. For example, if you give tokens to
  someone in exchange for sending an IBC packet, you must lock those tokens
  until the packet is acknowledged. Otherwise, the user could spend them before
  the packet is acknowledged and you would not be able to undo the transfer.

You can mix and match these strategies as needed, but be especially careful with
the second one. It is easy to make logical errors that can lead to problems.
