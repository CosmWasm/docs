# `AppBuilder`

[`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder] is an implementation of the [Builder Pattern] that provides a flexible
and modular way to construct the [`App{:rust}`](app) blockchain simulator. It allows smart contract developers
to configure various components of the blockchain simulator (e.g., Bank, Staking, Gov, IBC) individually
through dedicated `with_*` methods. Each method modifies and returns a new instance of the builder, enabling
method chaining for a fluent interface. The [`build(){:rust}`][build] method finalizes the construction
process, ensuring that all components are correctly initialized and integrated.

The following sections detail all builder functions, providing specific usage examples.

## `with_block`

While the default block configuration is sufficient for most test cases, you can initialize the
chain with a custom [`BlockInfo{:rust}`][BlockInfo] using the [`with_block(){:rust}`][with_block]
method provided by [`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder].

The following example demonstrates this use case in detail.

```rust showLineNumbers copy {15} /with_block/
use cosmwasm_std::{BlockInfo, Timestamp};
use cw_multi_test::{no_init, AppBuilder};

// create the chain builder
let builder = AppBuilder::default();

// prepare the custom block
let block = BlockInfo {
    height: 1,
    time: Timestamp::from_seconds(1723627489),
    chain_id: "starship-testnet".to_string(),
};

// build the chain initialized with the custom block
let app = builder.with_block(block).build(no_init);

// get the current block properties
let block = app.block_info();

// now the block height is 21
assert_eq!(1, block.height);

// now the block timestamp is Wed Aug 14 2024 09:24:49 GMT+0000
assert_eq!(1723627489, block.time.seconds());

// now the chain identifier is "starship-testnet"
assert_eq!("starship-testnet", block.chain_id);
```

The [`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder] is initialized with default settings in line 5. A custom block
is created in lines 8-12 and passed to the [`with_block(){:rust}`][with_block] method in line 15.
Since this is the only customization in this example, the blockchain construction is finalized in
the same line by calling the [`build(){:rust}`][build] function.

The current block metadata is retrieved in line 18, followed by value checks:

- line 21: the block height is now `1{:rust}`,
- line 24: the block time is set to the Unix timestamp `1723627489{:rust}`, representing
  `Wednesday, August 14, 2024, 09:24:49 GMT`,
- line 27: the chain identifier is now `"starship-testnet"{:rust}`.

The [`with_block(){:rust}`][with_block] method of [`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder] can be combined
with any other `with_*` methods to configure a custom starting block.
