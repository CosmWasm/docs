# Cryptography

CosmWasm offers cryptographic primitives that are implemented as VM intrinsics. This means that they
are more efficient than implementations in contract code could be, saving you gas and code size. In
some cases they are also _impossible_ to implement in contract code, since some of them require a
random intermediate value and randomness is generally not exposed to contracts to ensure
deterministic execution.

In the sidebar, you can find all the supported algorithms/curves along with documentation about
them.

## Gas costs

<Callout>
  Note that these values are in CosmWasm Gas (which is not equivalent to Cosmos SDK Gas; rather,
  CosmWasm Gas is eventually converted to Cosmos SDK Gas). For more info on gas, [check this page].

## Note on hash functions

You'll notice that CosmWasm does not implement any hash functions as native functions, and we intend
to keep it that way. The reasoning for that is:

- Hash functions are pretty much always cheap in terms of execution cost _and_ code size
- There are way too many hash functions out there, adding one would open the floodgates where we
  would have to add more
  - SHA-3 family, Keccak256, cSHAKE256, BLAKE2, BLAKE3, SHA-2 family, KangarooTwelve, etc. (and this
    is just a small sample set to drive the point home)
- Benchmarking and pricing functions (and keeping those up-to-date) correctly is a lot of work
- We want to keep the API surface as small as possible for ease of maintenance

Keep in mind that, thanks to Wasm being our execution environment, contract execution is quite fast.
In most cases the perceived need to move hashing into a host function is premature optimization and
not actually needed.
