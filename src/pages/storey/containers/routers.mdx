# Routers
A router is a special type that allows you to divide your storage space into multiple containers, each living under a single-byte key.

We expect your contracts will use a router as the "root" of your storage space basically always.

## Usage

The syntax for creating a router is somewhat similar to the syntax for defining a struct. The major differences are:
- the router definition needs to be inside a `router!` macro invocation
- the `router` keyword is used instead of `struct`
- before a field, a one-byte key needs to be provided, followed by a `->`

The one-byte keys need to be:
- unique within the router
- in the range of 0-254; the byte 255 is reserved for metadata

```rust template="storage" showLineNumbers {4-9}
use cw_storey::containers::Item;
use storey::containers::router;

router! {
    router Root {
        0 -> counter: Item<u32>,
        1 -> another: Item<u32>,
    }
}

assert_eq!(Root::access(&storage).admin().get().unwrap(), None);
Root::access(&storage).admin_mut().set(&5).unwrap();
```

A router can also be contained within another container - such as another router or a [`Map`](map).
