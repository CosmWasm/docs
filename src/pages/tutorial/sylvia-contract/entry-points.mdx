# Entry points

Typical Rust application starts with the `fn main()` function called by the operating system. Smart
contracts are not significantly different. When the message is sent to the contract, a function
called "entry point" is executed. Unlike native applications, which have only a single `main` entry
point, smart contracts have a couple of them, each corresponding to different message type:
`instantiate`, `execute`, `query`, `sudo`, `migrate` and more.

To start, we will go with three basic entry points:

- **`instantiate`** is called once per smart contract lifetime; you can think about it as a
  constructor or initializer of a contract.
- **`execute`** for handling messages which can modify contract state; they are used to perform some
  actual actions.
- **`query`** for handling messages requesting some information from a contract; unlike
  **`execute`**, they can never alter any contract state, and are used in a similar manner to
  database queries.

## Generate entry points

^Sylvia provides an attribute macro named
[`entry_points`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/attr.entry_points.html). In most cases, your
entry point will just dispatch received messages to the handler, so it's not necessary to manually
create them, and we can rely on a macro to do that for us.

Let's add the **`entry_points`** attribute macro to our contract:

```rust,noplayground
use cosmwasm_std::{Response, StdResult};
use sylvia::types::InstantiateCtx;
use sylvia::{contract, entry_points};

pub struct CounterContract;

#[entry_points]
#[contract]
impl CounterContract {
    pub const fn new() -> Self {
        Self
    }

    #[sv::msg(instantiate)]
    pub fn instantiate(&self, _ctx: InstantiateCtx) -> StdResult<Response> {
        Ok(Response::default())
    }
}
```

Note that **`#[entry_points]`** is added above the **`#[contract]`**. It is because
**`#[contract]`** removes attributes like **`#[sv::msg(...)]`** on which both these macros rely.

Always remember to place **`#[entry_points]`** first.

^Sylvia generates entry points with
[`#[entry_point]`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/1.3.1/cosmwasm_std/attr.entry_point.html) attribute
macro. Its purpose is to wrap the whole entry point to the form the Wasm runtime understands. The
proper Wasm entry points can use only basic types supported natively by Wasm specification, and Rust
structures and enums are not in this set. Working with such entry points would be overcomplicated,
so CosmWasm creators delivered the `entry_point` macro. It creates the raw Wasm entry point, calling
the decorated function internally and doing all the magic required to build our high-level Rust
arguments from arguments passed by Wasm runtime.

Now, when our contract has a proper entry point, let's build it and check if it's correctly defined:

```shell
contract $ cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --lib
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.03s

contract $ cosmwasm-check target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm
Available capabilities: {"stargate", "cosmwasm_1_3", "cosmwasm_1_1", "cosmwasm_1_2", "staking", "iterator"}

target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm: pass

All contracts (1) passed checks!
```

## Next step

Well done! We have now a proper `CosmWasm` contract. Let's add some state to it, so it will actually
be able to do something.
