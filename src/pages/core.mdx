# Introduction

This chapter will give you an overview over CosmWasm from a contract developer perspective, its
capabilities, and guide you through initializing your first smart contract.

<Callout>
  We assume you have basic knowledge of Rust and Cargo (Rust's standard build system). If not, have
  a look [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). No worries, you don't need to be a
  Rust expert to write your first contract.

## What is CosmWasm?

CosmWasm is a platform for writing smart contracts for Cosmos chains using Rust and WebAssembly.
Meaning CosmWasm is your one-stop shop for developing, testing, and running smart contracts on
enabled chains.

## What does CosmWasm provide?

For you, a contract developer, CosmWasm provides a set of high-quality primitives through our
standard library. These primitives include:

- extended precision arithmetic (128, 256, 512-bit integers)
- cryptographic primitives (for example, secp256k1 verification)
- interaction with the Cosmos SDK
- IBC connectivity

## What does CosmWasm _not_ provide?

- Abstractions to simplify contract development (for this, check out [Sylvia](/sylvia))
- Storage abstractions (for this, check out [Storey](/storey))
