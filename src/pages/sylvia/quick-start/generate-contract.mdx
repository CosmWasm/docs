# Generate contract

With the environment setup in the `getting-started` section, we can dive into
setting up a simple contract.

Run the `cargo-generate` command and give your contract a name. For simplicity
in learning `Sylvia` framework we will name it `counter`. This way, we will
avoid getting into possibly convoluted business logic and focus mainly on
learning the tool.

```shell
$ cargo generate CosmWasm/sylvia-template
   Favorite `CosmWasm/sylvia-template` not found in config, using it as a git repository: https://github.com/CosmWasm/sylvia-template.git
   Project Name: counter
   Destination: /home/user/counter ...
   project-name: counter ...
   Generating template ...
   Moving generated files into: `/home/user/counter`...
Initializing a fresh Git repository
   Done! New project created /home/user/counter
```

## Inspect `Cargo.toml`

First, we will investigate the `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[package]
name = "counter"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[features]
library = []

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2.0.2", features = ["staking"] }
sylvia = "1.0.2"
serde = "1.0.198"
schemars = "0.8"cosmwasm-schema = "2.0.2"
cw-storage-plus = "2.0.0"

[dev-dependencies]
sylvia = { version = "1.0.2", features = ["mt"] }
```

`Sylvia-template` contains a `library` feature. Its goal is to hide the entry
points of our contract for other developers who might want to use it in their
contracts. Otherwise, there would be conflicting implementations.

This template also setup `crate-type` with two values: - `cdylib` - Required to
compile the contract into `wasm` - `rlib` - Required for the contract to be used
as a dependency in another contract

`Sylvia-template` also defines some dependencies.

- [`cosmwasm-std`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/) - Crate
  that is a standard library for smart contracts. It provides essential
  utilities for communication with the outside world, helper functions, and
  types. Every smart contract we will build will use this dependency.
- [`sylvia`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/) - Crate, this documentation
  describes. It provides us with three procedural macros: `entry_points`,
  `contract`, and `interface`. We will expand on them later in the book.
- [`schemars`](https://docs.rs/schemars/latest/schemars/index.html) - Crate used
  to create `JSON` schema documents for our contracts. It is automatically
  derived on types generated by `Sylvia` and will be later used to provide
  concise API for blockchain users, who might not be Rust developers.
- [`cosmwasm-schema`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-schema/latest/cosmwasm_schema/) -
  Similar to `schemars`. This crate expands on `schemars` and provides us with
  trait
  [`QueryResponses`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-schema/latest/cosmwasm_schema/trait.QueryResponses.html)
  which ties query variants to their responses. We will expand on that later.
- [`serde`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/) - Framework for serializing and
  deserializing Rust data structures efficiently and generically.

In the case of `dev-dependencies`, we will also enable the `mt` flag in `Sylvia`
to generate `Multitest` helpers in the test environment.

## Project structure

The structure present in the `sylvia-template` is an example and you can set up
the project in any way you want.

- `src/lib.rs` - exposes contract modules. `src/contract.rs` - main module in
  which the contract is defined.
- `src/multitest/` - module in which we define our tests. It's a good practice
  to separate the tests between files semantically.
- `src/bin/schema.rs` - builds into a binary which generates the contract
  schema.
- `.cargo/config` - exposes some aliases to make working with the project
  simpler.
  - `cargo wasm` - run `cargo build` with additional options to compile a proper
    _wasm_ binary.
  - `cargo wasm-debug` - same as `cargo wasm`, but without `--release` profile
    to provide more debugging symbols. -
  - `cargo schema` - builds and runs the `src/schema.rs` for simpler schema
    generation.
