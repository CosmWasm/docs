# Multitest

Sylvia exposes several types that build on top of the [`Multitest`](../../cw-multi-test). These
types are supposed to be used next to [`the types`](../macros/generated-types/multitest) generated
by [`contract`](../macros/contract) and [`interface`](../macros/interface) macros.

<Callout>
  The types are hidden behind the `mt` feature flag. We recommend enabling it in the
  dev-dependencies.
</Callout>

Example usage of utilities described on this page as well as ones defined on the
[`generated types`](../macros/generated-types/multitest) page:

```rust, template="sylvia-cw-storage-contract"
use sylvia::cw_multi_test::IntoAddr;
use sylvia::multitest::App;

use super::interface::sv::mt::InterfaceProxy;
use super::sv::mt::{CodeId, CounterContractProxy};

#[test]
fn example_test() {
    // Define the [cosmwasm_std::Addr] of the message sender.
    let owner = "owner".into_addr();
    let dummy = "dummy".into_addr();

    // Initialize the [sylvia::multitest::App].
    let app = App::default();

    // Initialize the generated [contract::sv::mt::CodeId] by storing the contract code on the App.
    let code_id = CodeId::store_code(&app);

    // Initialize the contract by calling the [contract::sv::mt::CodeId::instantiate] method.
    let contract = code_id
        .instantiate(true)
        .with_label("MyContract")
        .call(&owner)
        .unwrap();

    // Send messages through the [sylvia::multitest::Proxy] as you would call the methods on
    // the contract type.
    contract.some_exec(dummy.to_string()).call(&owner).unwrap();
    contract.some_query(dummy.to_string()).unwrap();

    // Send interface messages the same way.
    contract
        .interface_exec(dummy.to_string())
        .call(&owner)
        .unwrap();
    contract.interface_query(dummy.to_string()).unwrap();
}
```

## App

The [`App`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.App.html) is a wrapper around the
[`cw-multi-test::App`](https://docs.rs/cw-multi-test/latest/cw_multi_test/struct.App.html), stored
inside the `RefCell`. It is done this way because the
[`App`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.App.html) has to be passed by
reference to multiple types, and we have to use the interior mutability to affect it's state.

## Proxy

The [`Proxy`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.Proxy.html) represents a single,
initialized contract. It is generic over it, and the `App` on which it's installed. The `Proxy` is
the structure through which you act on behalf of the contract, sending messages and querying the
state.

<Callout>
  The [`Proxy`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.Proxy.html) should not be
  constructed manually. Instead, create the contracts
  [`CodeId`](../macros/generated-types/multitest#codeid) instance and call `CodeId::instantiate`,
  which returns the [`Proxy`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.Proxy.html).
</Callout>

The [`Proxy`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.Proxy.html) by itself doesn't
have the methods defined in your contract. They are instead implemented via auto-generated traits by
[`contract`](../macros/contract) and [`interface`](../macros/interface) macros. Import the generated
proxy trait into your test scope to use these methods. If you want to learn more about the proxy
traits, you can go to [`this section`](../macros/generated-types/multitest#proxy-trait).

## ExecProxy

The [`ExecProxy`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.ExecProxy.html) is an
intermediate type, for setting additional data for the execute messages. It's main functionality is
the [`call`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.ExecProxy.html#method.call)
method, requiring the user to specify the caller of the message.

<Callout>
  The [`ExecProxy`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.ExecProxy.html) should not
  be constructed manually. Instead, it's supposed to be returned by execute methods exposed in the
  [`proxy traits`](../macros/generated-types/multitest#proxy-trait).
</Callout>

## MigrateProxy

The [`MigrateProxy`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.MigrateProxy.html) is an
intermediate type for setting additional data for the migrate messages. It's main functionality is
the [`call`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.MigrateProxy.html#method.call)
method, requiring the user to specify the caller of the message.

<Callout>
  The [`MigrateProxy`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/multitest/struct.MigrateProxy.html)
  should not be constructed manually. Instead, it's supposed to be returned by migrate methods
  exposed in the [`proxy traits`](../macros/generated-types/multitest#proxy-trait).
