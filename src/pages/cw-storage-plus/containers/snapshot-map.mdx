# SnapshotMap

A `SnapshotMap` is a key-value store like [`Map`]. It's worth familiarizing yourself with the `Map`
type first, as everything we talked about there is applicable to `SnapshotMap`.

On top of that, `SnapshotMap` makes it a little simpler to maintain a history of values at various
block heights. This involves saving "checkpoints" at some points in time - just how that is done is
decided by the [`Strategy`] type passed to the `SnapshotMap` constructor.

# Strategy

There are currently 3 built-in strategies, although in the future this might be open to extension.

- `EveryBlock` - a checkpoint is (conceptually) added at the beginning of every block, and
  historical data is available for any height
- `Never` - there's never a checkpoint saved, and the `SnapshotMap` is no different from a regular
  `Map` in terms of features. Any call to [`may_load_at_height`] will return `StdError::NotFound`
- `Selected` - the [`add_checkpoint`] method has to be called manually to add a checkpoint at the
  given height. Keep in mind that when calling [`may_load_at_height`] later, the height has to be
  the same as the one passed to [`add_checkpoint`]. If you try to load a value at a height when no
  checkpoint was saved, the method will return [`StdError::NotFound`].

## Usage examples

### Maintaining price histories for various trading pairs

<Callout>
  The constructor of `SnapshotMap` takes 3 "namespace" arguments: - the main namespace, similar to
  the `Map` constructor - two additional unique namespaces, which are used to store the changelog
  metadata
</Callout>

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::{SnapshotMap, Strategy};

let price: SnapshotMap<(&str, &str), Decimal> = SnapshotMap::new("p", "p1", "p2", Strategy::EveryBlock);

price
    .save(&mut storage, ("OSMO", "ATOM"), &Decimal::percent(81), env.block.height)
    .unwrap();

advance_height(&mut env, 50); // fast forward 50 blocks

price
    .save(&mut storage, ("OSMO", "ATOM"), &Decimal::percent(92), env.block.height)
    .unwrap();

// Before/at the first save, the price was unknown (uninitialized state)
assert_eq!(
    price
        .may_load_at_height(&storage, ("OSMO", "ATOM"), env.block.height - 60)
        .unwrap(),
    None
);
assert_eq!(
    price
        .may_load_at_height(&storage, ("OSMO", "ATOM"), env.block.height - 50)
        .unwrap(),
    None
);

// Before/at the current block, the price was 0.81
assert_eq!(
    price
        .may_load_at_height(&storage, ("OSMO", "ATOM"), env.block.height - 49)
        .unwrap(),
    Some(Decimal::percent(81))
);
assert_eq!(
    price
        .may_load_at_height(&storage, ("OSMO", "ATOM"), env.block.height)
        .unwrap(),
    Some(Decimal::percent(81))
);

// After the current block, the price will come up as 0.92
assert_eq!(
    price
        .may_load_at_height(&storage, ("OSMO", "ATOM"), env.block.height + 1)
        .unwrap(),
    Some(Decimal::percent(92))
);
assert_eq!(
    price
        .may_load_at_height(&storage, ("OSMO", "ATOM"),  env.block.height + 50)
        .unwrap(),
    Some(Decimal::percent(92))
);
