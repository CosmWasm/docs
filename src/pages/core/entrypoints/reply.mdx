# Reply

The `reply` endpoint is another special one.

It relates to CosmWasm's actor model which dictates how you call other contracts and interact with
them.

<Callout>
  If you are not familiar with the actor model, you can find out more about it on [its own page].
</Callout>

This endpoint gets invoked when you receive a response to a message you sent out over the chain. The
reply parameter then allows you to inspect and work with the response that was produced.

## Request a reply

To request a reply, you need to use the `reply_on` field in the message you send and set it to one
of the following values:

- `ReplyOn::Always`
- `ReplyOn::Error`
- `ReplyOn::Success`

<Callout>
  The `reply_on` value has an impact on when a transaction is cancelled. For more info, check the
  page about [transactions].
</Callout>

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
const CONTRACT_ADDR: &str = "other_contract";
const SUBMSG_ID: u64 = 1; // This is a unique identifier so we can associate a reply with a specific submessage. It can be any numeric value.

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: cosmwasm_std::Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    if msg.id != SUBMSG_ID {
        return Err(StdError::generic_err("Invalid submsg id"));
    }

    // We received a message! From the contract we invoked earlier.

    Ok(Response::default())
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: ExecuteMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
    let msg = WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: CONTRACT_ADDR.into(),
        msg: to_json_binary(&OtherContractMsg::DoSomething {}).unwrap(),
        funds: vec![],
    };

    let submsg = SubMsg::reply_always(msg, SUBMSG_ID);
    Ok(Response::new().add_submessage(submsg))
}
```

## Definition

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: cosmwasm_std::Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

## Handling the reply

Once the submessage handling is finished, the caller will get a chance to handle the result. It will
get the original `id` of the subcall and the `Result` of the execution, both success and error. Note
that it includes all events returned by the submessage, which applies to native sdk modules (like
Bank) as well as the contracts. If you need more state, you must save it in the local store during
the `execute` entry-point call, and load it in `reply`.

The `reply` call may return `Err` itself, in which case it is treated like the caller errored, and
aborting the sub-transaction. However, on successful processing, `reply` may return a normal
[`Response`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.Response.html), which will be
processed as normal - events added to the `EventManager`, and all `messages` dispatched as described
above. When `Err` is returned by a message handler, all changes made by the handler up to the reply
entry-point that returns the `Ok` response are reverted. More information can be found in the
following section.

The responses emitted by the submessage are gathered in the
[`msg_responses`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.SubMsgResponse.html#structfield.msg_responses)
field of the
[SubMsgResponse](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.SubMsgResponse.html)
structure. **Wasmd** allows chains to translate a single contract message into multiple SDK
messages. In that case all the message responses from each are concatenated into this flattened
`Vec`.
