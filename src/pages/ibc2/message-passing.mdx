# Message passing

Smart contracts can send IBCv2 (Inter-Blockchain Communication version 2) messages from all entry
points **except** `query`. This allows for interoperability between different blockchains through
structured message-passing mechanisms.

## Send IBCv2 messages

This section demonstrates how a smart contract can send IBCv2 messages by including them in the
response of an entry point (such as `execute`). It creates an `Ibc2Msg::SendPacket` message
containing a payload, which includes custom data serialized into JSON. The payload also defines
source and destination ports and client identifiers. The message is then returned in the contract's
`Response` to initiate the cross-chain communication.

```rust template="core"
#[cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde]
pub struct MyIbcMsg {
    pub msg: String
}

#[cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde]
pub struct ExecuteMsg;

#[entry_point]
pub fn execute(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    _msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    let msg = MyIbcMsg {
        msg: "Hello world!".to_owned()
    };

    let source_port = format!("wasm2{}", env.contract.address);
    let destination_port = "wasm2cosmos1suhgf5svhu4usrurvxzlgn54ksxmn8gljarjtxqnapv8kjnp4nrs2zhgh2".to_owned();
    let new_payload = Ibc2Payload::new(
        source_port,
        destination_port,
        "V1".to_owned(),
        "application/json".to_owned(),
        Binary::new(to_json_vec(&msg)?),
    );

    let new_msg = Ibc2Msg::SendPacket {
        source_client: "blockchains_source_client".to_owned(),
        payloads: vec![new_payload],
        timeout: env.block.time.plus_minutes(5_u64),
    };

    Ok(Response::default()
        .add_message(new_msg))
}
```

## Verify Messages Sent On Behalf Of The Contract

This section introduces a security check to ensure only the contract itself can send IBCv2 messages
using its assigned port ID. It shows the implementation of the `ibc2_packet_send` entry point, which
validates that the message signer matches the contract address. If not, the function returns an
error, preventing unauthorized IBCv2 message emissions.

```rust template="core"
#[entry_point]
pub fn ibc2_packet_send(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    msg: Ibc2PacketSendMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    if msg.signer != _env.contract.address {
        return Err(StdError::generic_err("Only this contract can send messages from it's IBCv2 port ID"));
    }
    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::default())
}
```

**Note:** It is possible to design a contract in such a way that other contracts can send IBCv2
messages using its port ID.

## Asynchronous Acknowledgements

To send a synchronous acknowledgement, devs can use the response of
[the receive entry point](entrypoints#receive-entry-point). This section explains how to handle
asynchronous acknowledgements for IBCv2 messages. In some scenarios, it may not be possible to
acknowledge a message immediately after processing it. In such cases, contracts can send
acknowledgements asynchronously by responding with an `Ibc2Msg::WriteAcknowledgement` message. The
provided example demonstrates how to write a success acknowledgement using the received packet
sequence. This mechanism ensures that both the sender and receiver are properly informed about the
successful processing of an IBCv2 message.

```rust template="core"
#[cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde]
pub struct MyIbcMsg {
    pub msg: String,
}

#[cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde]
pub struct ExecuteMsg {
    pub packet_sequence_to_ack: u64,
}

#[entry_point]
pub fn execute(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    Ok(
        Response::default().add_message(cosmwasm_std::Ibc2Msg::WriteAcknowledgement {
            source_client: "blockchains_source_client".to_owned(),
            packet_sequence: msg.packet_sequence_to_ack,
            ack: IbcAcknowledgement::new(StdAck::success(b"Success")),
        }),
    )
}
```
