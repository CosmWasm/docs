# Containers

A container is an abstraction that manages how some data should be stored and
retrieved. Sometimes this is as simple as a single value
([`Item`](containers/item)), sometimes there's more to it than that.

For most of your needs, you can likely do what you need to with the built-in
containers:

- [`Item`](containers/item)
- [`Map`](containers/map)
- [`Column`](containers/column)

For more advanced use cases, you can build your own containers as described in
the [_Implementing new containers_](container-impl) section.

# Namespace

To construct a container, you need to provide a single byte. This byte is used
to distinguish between different "root" containers in the same storage space.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storey::containers::Item;

let item: Item<u32> = Item::new(0); // byte 0 is used as the namespace
let map: Map<String, Item<u32>> = Map::new(1); // byte 1 is used as the namespace
```

A container will assume it's free to save stuff under the given key (e.g. `A`),
and any key that starts with that same byte (e.g. `A28F`). In this way, a whole
namespace is reserved for the container.

<Callout>
An item will simply store its value under the given byte, while a map will
store its values under keys that are prefixed with the given byte. How exactly
the namespace is managed is up to the container implementation.
</Callout>

To avoid key collisions, you must provide a different byte to each container.

# Composition

Some containers can be composed together to create more complex data structures.
Right now, the only built-in container that supports composition is the `Map`
container.

This is an alternative design largely used to achieve the same effect as
"composite keys" in `cw-storage-plus` (think tuple keys like `(String, u32)`),
but also make this more flexible - you can put a `Column` or any other container
inside a `Map`!

Let's compare the two approaches:

<Tabs items={[`cw-storage-plus`, `storey`]} defaultIndex={0}> <Tabs.Tab>

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::Map;

let map: Map<(String, String), u32> = Map::new("m");

map.save(&mut storage, ("foo".to_string(), "bar".to_string()), &42)
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    map.load(&storage, ("foo".to_string(), "bar".to_string())),
    Ok(42)
);
```

</Tabs.Tab> <Tabs.Tab>

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storey::containers::{Map, Item};
use cw_storey::CwStorage;

let map: Map<String, Map<String, Item<u32>>> = Map::new(0);

map.access(&mut CwStorage(&mut storage))
    .entry_mut("foo")
    .entry_mut("bar")
    .set(&42)
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    map.access(&CwStorage(&storage))
        .entry("foo")
        .entry("bar")
        .get()
        .unwrap(),
    Some(42)
);
```

</Tabs.Tab></Tabs>

It's possible to define custom containers that enable composition similar to
maps. If done properly, they can be mixed with any other containers, including
built-in ones.

# Encoding

Types like `Item` or `Column` need a way to encode values in a binary store. If
you're using the `Item` and `Column` types from `cw-storey`, the
[MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) format is used. This is a binary encoding
that should generally be a storage performance improvement over JSON.

If you need to use a different encoding, you can instead import the
`Item`/`Column` type from the `storey` crate and specify an alternative
encoding. A guide to implementing your encoding can be found in the
[_Alternative encodings_](encodings) section.
