# IndexedMap

An
[`IndexedMap`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.IndexedMap.html)
is a map that, apart from the usual map key `K` has some secondary indexes `I`
that can be used to look up values.

<Callout>
  There's no limit to how many indexes you can have, but be careful. Using many
  indexes can increase the complexity of storage writes - with every write, the
  list of indexes is iterated over since they might need to be updated.
</Callout>

As always, we encourage you to explore the
[`API reference`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.IndexedMap.html)
for a full list of available methods and more rigid definitions of the types
involved.

## Case study: User lookup

Imagine we have a list of users. Every user is uniquely identified by their
address, so it makes sense to use that as the primary key. We'll need to look up
users by their address - if Alice calls the contract, we should be able to look
up her user data by the address with which she called.

<Callout>
  Every snippet on this page builds on the previous ones. Make sure you've
  understood the previous snippet before moving on to the next one, and feel
  free to go back and forth as needed.
</Callout>

This is easy to model with a normal `Map`.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::Map;

type Handle = String;

#[cw_serde]
struct User {
    handle: Handle,
    country: String,
}

let _users = Map::<Addr, User>::new("u");
```

Great! But what if we want to look up users by their handles? Our only real
option here is to iterate over all users and check if the handle matches. With a
big enough user base, this could be slow and expensive.

### Setting up an `IndexedMap` with a `UniqueIndex`

A better way would be to maintain a secondary index. Let's try to do this.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::{index_list, IndexedMap, UniqueIndex};

use crate::users::*;

#[index_list(User)]
struct UserIndexes<'a> {
    handle_ix: UniqueIndex<'a, Handle, User, Addr>,
}

let user_indexes = UserIndexes {
    handle_ix: UniqueIndex::new(|user| user.handle.clone(), "uh"),
};

let _users = IndexedMap::<Addr, _, _>::new("u", user_indexes);
```

<Callout>
  The `index_list` macro is used to define a list of indexes for a given struct.
  This is a helper macro that generates an implementation of the
  [`IndexList`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/trait.IndexList.html)
  trait, with all the fields of the struct as indexes.
</Callout>

Here's what happens step-by-step

- We define a struct `UserIndexes` that holds all the indexes we want to use. In
  this case, we only have one index - `handle`, indexing the `handle` field.
- We construct our `UserIndexes`. Notice the `UniqueIndex` constructor takes two
  parameters:
  - A function pointer (here we provide an anonymous function). This function is
    supposed to take the value of an entry and produce the secondary key.
    Without this, the `IndexedMap` would not know how to create the index.
  - A prefix. The index needs its own storage namespace. Note the index prefix
    has to be distinct from the `IndexedMap` prefix (or any other prefix used
    with this contract's storage).
- We construct an `IndexedMap` with that list of indexes.

<Callout>
  Note the `UniqueIndex` type has three type parameters. The order might be
  slightly confusing, but here it goes:

- The secondary key type (`Handle` in our case).
- The value type (`User` in our case).
- The primary key type (`Addr` in our case).

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  If you're using
  [`UniqueIndex`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.UniqueIndex.html),
  it's your responsibility to ensure that the index you've built has unique
  keys. If you have two users with the same handle, the index will be
  overwritten and only contain the last user. Be careful! If you need to store a
  key that is not unique, you'll want to use a
  [`MultiIndex`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.MultiIndex.html)
  - see [*Lookup by country*](#lookup-by-country).
</Callout>

<Callout>
Under the hood, the `IndexedMap` will store the data using a regular `Map` for
the primary key, and then another `Map` for each secondary index. This is how efficient lookups are achieved.

Again, every update to this storage structure will have to update all the
indexes - that's the price we pay for efficient lookups.

</Callout>

### Taking advantage of the secondary index

As with a regular `Map`, you can
[load](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.IndexedMap.html#method.load)
data,
[save](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.IndexedMap.html#method.save)
data,
[remove](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.IndexedMap.html#method.remove)
data, and iterate over the `IndexedMap`.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::IndexedMap;

use crate::users::*;

let users = IndexedMap::<Addr, _, _>::new("u", user_indexes());

let alice_addr = Addr::unchecked("aaa");
let alice_user = User {
    handle: "alice".to_string(),
    country: "Wonderland".to_string(),
};

let bob_addr = Addr::unchecked("bbb");
let bob_user = User {
    handle: "bob".to_string(),
    country: "Bikini Bottom".to_string(),
};

users
    .save(&mut storage, alice_addr.clone(), &alice_user)
    .unwrap();

users
    .save(&mut storage, bob_addr.clone(), &bob_user)
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    users.load(&storage, alice_addr.clone()).unwrap(),
    alice_user
);

assert_eq!(
    users
        .range(&storage, None, None, Order::Ascending)
        .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()
        .unwrap(),
    vec![
        (alice_addr.clone(), alice_user.clone()),
        (bob_addr.clone(), bob_user.clone()),
    ]
);
```

But now we can also look up users by their handle.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::IndexedMap;

use crate::users::*;

let (_key, alice) = users
    .idx
    .handle_ix                           // access the `handle_ix` index
    .item(&storage, "alice".to_string()) // load a specific record
    .unwrap()
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    alice,
    User {
        handle: "alice".to_string(),
        country: "Wonderland".to_string(),
    }
);
```

We can also iterate over records using bounds based on the secondary index.
Here's how we can find all user handles starting with "a" or "b".

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::{Bound, IndexedMap};

use crate::users::*;

let found_users = users
    .idx
    .handle_ix
    .range(
        &storage,
        Some(Bound::inclusive("a")),
        Some(Bound::exclusive("c")),
        Order::Ascending,
    )
    .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(found_users.len(), 2);
assert_eq!(
    found_users[0],
    (
        Addr::unchecked("aaa"),
        User {
            handle: "alice".to_string(),
            country: "Wonderland".to_string(),
        }
    )
);
assert_eq!(found_users[1].1.handle, "bob");
```

<Callout type="warning">
Note when iterating like this, the items yielded are of type `(PK::Output, V)`,
where `PK` is the primary key type of the `IndexedMap` and `V` is the value.

The `PK::Output` associated type is generally just the owned version of the `PK`
type. For example, if `PK` is `Addr`, `PK::Output` will be `Addr`. If it's a
`String` or a `&str`, `PK::Output` will be a `String`.

What's important and possibly surprising is we **don't** get back the secondary
index. Because of that, it's sadly hard to implement anything like pagination
with secondary key iteration.

</Callout>

If we're only interested in the addresses (primary keys in our case), we can use
the `keys` method.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::{Bound, IndexedMap};

use crate::users::*;

let found_keys = users
    .idx
    .handle_ix
    .keys(&storage, Some(Bound::inclusive("b")), None, Order::Ascending)
    .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(found_keys, [
    Addr::unchecked("bbb"),
    Addr::unchecked("ccc"),
    Addr::unchecked("ddd"),
]);
```

### Lookup by country

Let's say we want to look up users by their country. This time, we'll use a
`MultiIndex` instead of a `UniqueIndex`. This is because multiple users can be
from the same country.

```rust template="storage" showLineNumbers
use cw_storage_plus::{index_list, IndexedMap, MultiIndex, UniqueIndex};

use crate::users::*;

#[index_list(User)]
struct UserIndexes<'a> {
    handle_ix: UniqueIndex<'a, Handle, User, Addr>,
    country_ix: MultiIndex<'a, String, User, Addr>,
}

let user_indexes = UserIndexes {
    handle_ix: UniqueIndex::new(|user| user.handle.clone(), "uh"),
    country_ix: MultiIndex::new(|_pk, user| user.country.clone(), "u", "uc"),
};

let _users = IndexedMap::<Addr, _, _>::new("u", user_indexes);
```

Note that the `MultiIndex` constructor (line 13) takes three parameters:

- A closure that produces the secondary key. This is similar to the
  `UniqueIndex` constructor's first parameter.
- A namespace for the map. This is supposed to be the same value as the prefix
  used for the `IndexedMap`.
- A prefix for the index. This is supposed to be distinct from the prefix used
  for the `IndexedMap`, and is similar to the `UniqueIndex` constructor's second
  parameter.

Let's take advantage of the new index. We'll find all users from the USA. The
call chain is a bit different here, so hang on tight.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::{Bound, IndexedMap};

use crate::users::*;

let us_users = users
    .idx
    .country_ix
    .prefix("USA".to_string())
    .range(&storage, None, None, Order::Ascending)
    .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(us_users, [
    (
        Addr::unchecked("bbb"),
        User {
            handle: "bob".to_string(),
            country: "USA".to_string(),
        }
    ),
    (
        Addr::unchecked("ddd"),
        User {
            handle: "dave".to_string(),
            country: "USA".to_string(),
        }
    ),
]);
```

Due to technical limitations, the `MultiIndex` does not support **bounded**
iteration over the secondary key for dynamically sized types (like `Addr` or
`String`). For example, this means we can't find out all the entries for
countries starting with "U". If your secondary index is something with a fixed
size (like `u32` or `[u8; 32]`), bounds should work just fine.

<Callout>
The technical reason for this is that the `MultiIndex` is implemented as a
`Map<(IK, PK), _>` under the hood, where `IK` is the secondary key and `PK` is
the primary key. This means it's subject to the same limitations as compound keys in general.
</Callout>

If you're interested in iterating over all the entries in a `MultiIndex`, you
can use the `range` method without bounds. As before, there's also the
[`keys`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.MultiIndex.html#method.keys)
method for when values don't matter to you.
