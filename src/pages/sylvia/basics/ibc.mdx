# IBC

Sylvia doesn't generate any [IBC](../../ibc) related code, but you can define
your own [IBC entry points](../../ibc/diy-protocol#Entrypoints) like you would
in the case of a regular CosmWasm contract.

You can define the logic inside the contract and call the method from the entry
point.

```rust {14-21, 32, 30}
pub struct IbcContract;

#[contract]
impl IbcContract {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self
    }

    #[sv::msg(instantiate)]
    fn instantiate(&self, _ctx: InstantiateCtx) -> StdResult<Response> {
        Ok(Response::new())
    }

    pub fn ibc_channel_open(
        &self,
        deps: DepsMut,
        env: Env,
        msg: IbcChannelOpenMsg,
    ) -> StdResult<IbcChannelOpenResponse> {
        // Your logic here
    }
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_channel_open(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    msg: IbcChannelOpenMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcChannelOpenResponse> {
    IbcContract::new().ibc_channel_open(deps, env, msg)
}
```

You can also define a trait for the IBC methods and implement it for on the
contract.

```rust {7, 10, 12-13, 21-22}
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_channel_open(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    msg: IbcChannelOpenMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcChannelOpenResponse> {
    IbcContract::new().ibc_channel_open(deps, env, msg)
}

pub struct IbcContract;

pub trait Ibc {
    fn ibc_channel_open(
        &self,
        deps: DepsMut,
        env: Env,
        msg: IbcChannelOpenMsg,
    ) -> StdResult<IbcChannelOpenResponse>;
}

impl Ibc for IbcContract {
    fn ibc_channel_open(
        &self,
        deps: DepsMut,
        env: Env,
        msg: IbcChannelOpenMsg,
    ) -> StdResult<IbcChannelOpenResponse> {
        // Your logic here
    }
}
```

Remember not to use the interface attribute for this trait. Sylvia does not
handle IBC entry points, and there is no point in generating helpers around
them.
