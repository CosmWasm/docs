# Getting started

This unit is designed to help you quickly become familiar with the fundamental aspects of testing
smart contracts using **`MultiTest`**. It provides a practical example and best practices to ensure
a smooth start with using **`MultiTest`** for testing smart contracts. In the following chapters,
you will be:

- designing example [**counter**](getting-started/counter.mdx) smart contract,
- [**writing tests**](getting-started/writing-tests.mdx) for the counter smart contract.

The example **counter** smart contract and all test cases are provided in two versions: one using
pure CosmWasm libraries and the other using the Sylvia framework. The functionality of the
**counter** smart contract is the same in both versions.
