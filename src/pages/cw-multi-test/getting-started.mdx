# Getting started

This unit is designed to help you quickly become familiar with the fundamental aspects of testing
smart contracts using **`MultiTest`**. It provides a practical example and best practices to ensure
a frictionless start with using **`MultiTest`** for testing smart contracts. In the following
chapters, you will find a [**counter**](getting-started/counter.mdx) smart contract example for
which we will be [writing tests](getting-started/writing-tests.mdx), along with some
[best practices](getting-started/best-practices.mdx) for testing with **`MultiTest`**.

(todo: add the overview of the whole chapter when ready - with links)
