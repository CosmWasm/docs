# Item

An [`Item`] is the simplest container. It stores a single value at a specific key.

An `Item` that's never been [`set`] is empty, and will return `None` upon a [`get`].

## Usage examples

### Saving an admin address

Quite often it is necessary for a contract to keep track of who is its "owner" or "admin". In order
to do that, we can store an admin address (usually in instantiation). Later, the address of the
caller can be matched against this address in execution endpoints.

Here's how to store and manipulate an admin address, or any other simple data.

```rust template="storage" showLineNumbers {5,7-10,12-14,17}
use cw_storey::containers::Item;
use storey::containers::router;

router! {
    router Root {
        0 -> admin: Item<String>,
    }
}

assert_eq!(
    Root::access(&storage).admin().get().unwrap(),
    None,
);

Root::access(&mut storage)
    .admin_mut()
    .set(&String::from("some_address"))
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    Root::access(&storage).admin().get().unwrap(),
    Some(String::from("some_address")),
);
```

- _line 5:_ Here we construct the `Item` facade. The constructor takes a key, which is the key the
  data will be stored at in the underlying storage backend. See also
  [_Containers - Namespace_](.#namespace).
- _lines 7-10_: This assertion is just to show you the `Item` is empty (`Option::None`) before it's
  initialized.
- _lines 12-14_: Here we commit a value to storage.
- _line 17_: Here we retrieve the value from storage.

### Maintaining a config structure

It's also common to save a whole struct in an `Item`, with a variety of data. Often the struct
represents a contract's "config".

```rust template="storage" showLineNumbers {5}
use cw_storey::containers::Item;
use storey::containers::router;

#[cw_serde]
struct Config {
    pub admin: String,
    pub interest_rate: Decimal,
}

router! {
    router Root {
        0 -> admin: Item<Config>,
    }
}

let mut access = Root::access(&mut storage);

let cfg = Config {
    admin: "some_address".to_string(),
    interest_rate: Decimal::percent(5),
};

access.admin_mut().set(&cfg).unwrap();
assert_eq!(access.admin().get().unwrap(), Some(cfg));
```

Note the highlighted line. The struct must be encodable. For _CosmWasm_ contracts this generally
means it implements `serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}`. The best idiomatic way to achieve that is by
using the `cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde` macro we provide.

### Default values

Sometimes you might like to read a value, but expect to receive a default if it's never been
initialized. This is a common pattern for counters or other numeric values.

```rust template="storage" showLineNumbers {8}
use cw_storey::containers::Item;
use storey::containers::router;

router! {
    router Root {
        0 -> counter: Item<u32>,
    }
}


let mut access = Root::access(&mut storage);

let mut total = access.counter().get().unwrap().unwrap_or(0);

assert_eq!(total, 0);
total += 1;

access.counter_mut().set(&total).unwrap();
```

There's no magic here, just
[`Option::unwrap_or`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap_or) at the
highlighted line. This is less a feature of the framework and more a pattern you might find useful.
