# Building the contract

Now that our contract correctly compiles into Wasm, let's digest our build command.

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --lib
```

The `--target` argument tells cargo to perform cross-compilation for a given target, instead of
building a native binary for an OS it is running on. In this case the target is
`wasm32-unknown-unknown`, which is a fancy name for Wasm target.

Our contract would be also properly compiled without `--lib` flag, but later, when we add `query`,
this flag will be required, so using it from the beginning is a good habit.

Additionally, I passed the `--release` argument to the command - it is not required, but in most
cases, debug information is not very useful while running on-chain. It is crucial to reduce the
uploaded binary size for gas cost minimization. It is worth knowing that there is a
[CosmWasm Rust Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) tool that takes care of
building even smaller binaries. For production, all the contracts should be compiled using this
tool, but it is now not essential for learning purposes.

## Aliasing build command

Now I see you are disappointed in building your contracts with some overcomplicated command instead
of simple `cargo build`. Hopefully, it is not the case. The common practice is to alias the building
command, to make it as simple as building a native application.

Let's create `.cargo/config.toml` file in your contract project directory with the following
content:

```toml copy filename=".cargo/config.toml"
[alias]
wasm = "build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --lib"
wasm-debug = "build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --lib"
```

Building your Wasm binary is now as easy as executing `cargo wasm`. We also added the additional
`wasm-debug` command for rare cases, when we want to build the Wasm binary with debug information
included.

## Checking contract validity

When the contract is built, the last step to ensure that it is a valid CosmWasm contract is to call
`cosmwasm-check` on it:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo wasm && cosmwasm-check ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm
```

```shell filename="TERMINAL"
Available capabilities: {"cosmwasm_1_2", "cosmwasm_1_4", "stargate", "cosmwasm_1_1", "cosmwasm_2_1", "cosmwasm_1_3", "cosmwasm_2_0", "staking", "iterator"}

./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm: pass

All contracts (1) passed checks!
```
