`Cargo.toml` file is a configuration file for a Rust project, in our case for a smart contract
written in Rust. Here's a detailed explanation of each section and what it's doing.

**\[package\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{1} filename="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "counter"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

- **`[package]`** section provides metadata about the Rust package (smart contract library in our
  case).
- **`name = "counter"`** specifies the name of the package, it's named **counter** like our smart
  contract.
- **`version = "0.1.0"`** indicates the current version of the package and the counter smart
  contract.
- **`edition = "2021"`** specifies the Rust edition being used; editions in Rust are sets of
  language and compiler improvements, with 2021 being one of the latest editions at the time,
  providing the latest features and enhancements.

**\[lib\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{8} filename="Cargo.toml"
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
```

- **`[lib]`** section specifies settings for building the library.
- **`crate-type`** enumerates types of libraries to be produced during compiling.
- **`"cdylib"`** specifies that the package will be compiled as a C-compatible dynamic library;
  which is required for smart contracts to run on the CosmWasm runtime.
- **`"rlib"`** specifies a Rust library file that can be used as a dependency for other Rust
  projects, in our case for other smart contracts.

**\[features\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{11} filename="Cargo.toml"
[features]
# use library feature to disable all instantiate/execute/query exports
library = []
```

- **`[features]`** section defines optional features for the Rust package.
- **`library = []`** defines a feature named **library**, which when set, disables exporting smart
  contract entry-points.

**\[dependencies\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{15} filename="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
cosmwasm-schema = "2"
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2" }
cw-storage-plus = "2"
schemars = "0.8"
serde = "1.0"
```

- **`[dependencies]`** section lists the libraries that the package depends on.
- **`cosmwasm-schema`** is used for generating JSON schemas from Rust data structures, which is
  useful for documentation and ensuring compatibility of messages and queries.
- **`cosmwasm-std`** is the standard library for CosmWasm contracts, providing common types and
  utilities needed for interacting with the CosmWasm runtime.
- **`cw-storage-plus`** is a library that provides advanced storage abstractions and utilities on
  top of the basic storage capabilities in CosmWasm, making it easier to manage state within
  contracts.
- **`schemars`** is a library for generating JSON schemas, which complements `cosmwasm-schema` by
  providing additional features for schema generation.
- **`serde`** is a widely used serialization library in Rust, allowing easy conversion of Rust data
  structures to and from formats like JSON, which is crucial for data interchange in smart
  contracts.

**\[dev-dependencies\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{22} filename="Cargo.toml"
[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = { version = "2", features = ["cosmwasm_2_0"] }
```

- **`[dev-dependencies]`** section lists dependencies that are only needed for development and
  testing.
- **`cw-multi-test`** is a name of **`MultiTest`** library, and should **ALWAYS**Â ðŸš¨ be placed in
  `[dev-dependencies]` section.

Overall, this `Cargo.toml` file configures a Rust project for a CosmWasm-based smart contract. It
sets up the basic package details, specifies how the contract should be compiled, defines
dependencies for core functionality and testing, and includes features to enable or disable certain
parts of the contract code. This setup ensures the contract can be developed, tested, and deployed
effectively within the CosmWasm ecosystem.

### lib.rs

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="lib.rs"
pub mod contract;
pub mod msg;
```

<Cards>
  <Card title="ðŸ¦˜Â Â Skip explanations this time" href="#msgrs" icon="" children="" />
</Cards>

The `lib.rs` file in a Rust project serves as the main entry point for defining the structure of a
library. In the context of our example **counter** smart contract, the `lib.rs` file is defining and
organizing the modules that make up the contract. Recall the **counter** project file structure:

```ansi {4,6} filename="counter (directory)"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ [34;1msrc[0m
    â”œâ”€â”€ contract.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
    â””â”€â”€ msg.rs
```

We have two modules in our project `contract.rs` and `msg.rs`, so in the `lib.rs` file:

- **`pub mod contract;`** line declares a public module named **contract**; tells Rust to include
  the code from a file named `contract.rs` located in the same directory and makes the module
  publicly accessible (`pub` keyword), this means other modules or external code can access the
  entry-points of our smart contract.
- **`pub mod msg;`** line declares a public module named **msg**; includes the code from a file
  named `msg.rs` and also makes this module public which allows other parts of the code (especially
  our **counter** smart contract) to access the messages defined here.

Overall, this `lib.rs` file is setting up the main structure of the smart contract by defining its
key components as separate modules. This organization helps in keeping the code clean, modular, and
maintainable by separating the core contract logic (`contract.rs`) from the message and query
definitions (`msg.rs`). This modular approach makes the smart contract easier to understand, extend,
and test.

### msg.rs

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="msg.rs"
use cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde;

#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterInitMsg {
    Zero,
    Set(u8),
}

#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterActionMsg {
    Inc,
    Dec,
    Set(u8),
}

#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterQuery {
    Value,
}

#[cw_serde]
pub struct CounterResponse {
    pub value: u8,
}
```

<Cards>
  <Card title="ðŸ¦˜Â Â Skip explanations this time" href="#contractrs" icon="" children="" />
</Cards>

The **msg** module in file `msg.rs` typically defines the messages and queries that the smart
contract accepts and responds to. Messages are usually structured as Rust enums or structs and
define the input and output interfaces of the contract. In our example this includes:

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="msg.rs"
use cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde;
```

Required imports, like `#[cw_serde]` annotation.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{3} filename="msg.rs (CounterInitMsg)"
#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterInitMsg {
    Zero,
    Set(u8),
}
```

**`CounterInitMsg{:rust}`** enumeration, used to initialize the contract.
`CounterInitMsg::Zero{:rust}` variant initializes the counter with zero value, and
`CounterInitMsg::Set{:rust}` variant initializes the counter with an arbitrary value in range 0
to 255. This message is passed to `instantiate{:rust}` entry-point of the counter smart contract.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{9} filename="msg.rs (CounterActionMsg)"
#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterActionMsg {
    Inc,
    Dec,
    Set(u8),
}
```

**`CounterActionMsg{:rust}`** enumeration, used to perform various actions within the contract,
especially incrementing (the `CounterActionMsg::Inc{:rust}` variant), decrementing (the
`CounterActionMsg::Dec{:rust}` variant) and setting an arbitrary counter value (the
`CounterActionMsg::Set{:rust}` variant). This message is passed to `execute{:rust}` entry-point of
the counter smart contract.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{16} filename="msg.rs (CounterQuery)"
#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterQuery {
    Value,
}
```

**`CounterQuery{:rust}`** enumeration, with its single variant `CounterQuery::Value{:rust}`, used to
query the state of the contract, in our case to retrieve the current counter value. This message is
passed to `query{:rust}` entry-point of the counter smart contract.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{21} filename="msg.rs (CounterResponse)"
#[cw_serde]
pub struct CounterResponse {
    pub value: u8,
}
```

**`CounterResponse{:rust}`** struct with single field `value{:rust}`, used to pass the responses
(results) from queries.

Overall, this `msg.rs` file is basically setting up the contractâ€™s _social skills_, defining how it
interacts with the outside world by initializing, taking actions, and answering questions. Each
message type is a different way of communicating with the counter, making it an easy-going,
versatile _contract_ ready for action.

### contract.rs

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg(not(feature = "library"))]
use cosmwasm_std::entry_point;

use crate::msg::{CounterActionMsg, CounterInitMsg, CounterQuery, CounterResponse};
use cosmwasm_std::{to_json_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdError};
use cw_storage_plus::Item;

const COUNTER: Item<u8> = Item::new("value");

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: CounterInitMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
    COUNTER.save(
        deps.storage,
        &match msg {
            CounterInitMsg::Zero => 0,
            CounterInitMsg::Set(value) => value,
        },
    )?;
    Ok(Response::default())
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: CounterActionMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
    COUNTER.update::<_, StdError>(deps.storage, |old_value| {
        Ok(match msg {
            CounterActionMsg::Inc => old_value.saturating_add(1),
            CounterActionMsg::Dec => old_value.saturating_sub(1),
            CounterActionMsg::Set(new_value) => new_value,
        })
    })?;
    Ok(Response::default())
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: CounterQuery) -> Result<Binary, StdError> {
    match msg {
        CounterQuery::Value => Ok(to_json_binary(&CounterResponse {
            value: COUNTER.may_load(deps.storage).unwrap().unwrap(),
        })?),
    }
}
```

Typically, in a smart contract project, the **contract** module â€’ placed in the `contract.rs` file â€’
contains the core logic of the contract, including functions (entry-points) for instantiation,
execution, querying and migrating. This is where the main functionality of the smart contract is
implemented. And this is also the case for our **counter** smart contract.

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg(not(feature = "library"))]
use cosmwasm_std::entry_point;
```

```rust copy showLineNumbers{4} filename="contract.rs"
use crate::msg::{CounterActionMsg, CounterInitMsg, CounterQuery, CounterResponse};
use cosmwasm_std::{to_json_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdError};
use cw_storage_plus::Item;
```

```rust copy showLineNumbers{8} filename="contract.rs"
const COUNTER: Item<u8> = Item::new("value");
```

```rust copy showLineNumbers{10} filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: CounterInitMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
    COUNTER.save(
        deps.storage,
        &match msg {
            CounterInitMsg::Zero => 0,
            CounterInitMsg::Set(value) => value,
        },
    )?;
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

```rust copy showLineNumbers{27} filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: CounterActionMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
    COUNTER.update::<_, StdError>(deps.storage, |old_value| {
        Ok(match msg {
            CounterActionMsg::Inc => old_value.saturating_add(1),
            CounterActionMsg::Dec => old_value.saturating_sub(1),
            CounterActionMsg::Set(new_value) => new_value,
        })
    })?;
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

```rust copy showLineNumbers{44} filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: CounterQuery) -> Result<Binary, StdError> {
    match msg {
        CounterQuery::Value => Ok(to_json_binary(&CounterResponse {
            value: COUNTER.may_load(deps.storage).unwrap().unwrap(),
        })?),
    }
}
```
