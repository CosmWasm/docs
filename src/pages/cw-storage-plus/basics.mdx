# Basics

## Containers

`cw-storage-plus` provides several storage containers that can be used to store data on the
blockchain. The fundamental ones are:

- [`Item`](containers/item)
- [`Map`](containers/map)
- [`Deque`](containers/deque)

An [`Item`](containers/item) is a simple container that stores a single value. The other two are a
little more involved - they are collections capable of storing multiple values, and provide several
methods to interact with them.

## Keys and prefixes

One task of a storage library like `cw-storage-plus` is to manage the namespace of keys provided by
the blockchain.

When constructing a container, you must provide a key of type `&'static str` (or use
[`new_dyn`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.Item.html#method.new_dyn)).
This usually means you'll be providing a string literal or some constant.

In the case of an [`Item`](containers/item), the provided string is the exact key (a standard UTF-8
string) under which the value will be saved. In the case of collections, the provided string is a
prefix (sometimes called `namespace` in the code); the collection will use this prefix to generate
keys (by appending to it) for the individual values it stores.

As a contract dev, it is your responsibility to ensure that the keys you provide are unique and do
not conflict with keys used by other parts of the contract.

<Callout>
  Over time, we've learned that using long keys hurts storage performance. If you _gotta go fast_, a
  good approach might be to only provide single-character ASCII prefixes for your containers, like
  _"a"_, _"b"_, _"c"_, etc.
</Callout>

Generally speaking, we tried to make it so that as long as you use a unique prefix for each
container, you shouldn't have to worry about key conflicts.

TODO: Research the key collisions in the warning below more! Then we can provide better advice.

<Callout type="warning">
  ...yet there's a small _but_. A `Map`'s prefix is length-prefixed. An `Item` is saved without any
  sort of length-prefixing of the key. It is, in theory, possible for an `Item`'s key to conflict
  with one of the keys generated by a `Map` or `Deque`. In practice, this is unlikely unless you use
  very long prefixes or start your `Item`'s key with the null byte. Probably don't do that!
</Callout>

## Values

In `cw-storage-plus`, every value is saved using JSON serialization. For that to be possible, only
types that implement [`serde::Serialize`](https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.201/serde/trait.Serialize.html)
and [`serde::Deserialize`](https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.201/serde/trait.Deserialize.html) are allowed.

Most of the Rust standard library types already implement these traits. Additionally, types you'll
find in `cosmwasm_std` (like
[`Addr`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/2.0.3/cosmwasm_std/struct.Addr.html),
[`Decimal`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/2.0.3/cosmwasm_std/struct.Decimal.html),
[`Binary`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/2.0.3/cosmwasm_std/struct.Binary.html) or
[`Coin`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/2.0.3/cosmwasm_std/struct.Coin.html)) often do as well.

If you're writing a custom type and wish to send it across call or put it in storage, you'll have to
derive these traits.

  *cw-storage-plus* uses [*serde-json-wasm*](https://github.com/CosmWasm/serde-json-wasm) under the
  hood. This provides determinism in some corners - [*serde_json*](https://github.com/serde-rs/json)
  would not be suited for the blockchain world! On top of that, `serde-json-wasm` is just smaller.
