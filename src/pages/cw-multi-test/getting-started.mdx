# Getting started

This unit is designed to help you quickly become familiar with the fundamental aspects of testing
smart contracts using **`MultiTest`**. It provides a practical example and best practices to ensure
a smooth start with using **`MultiTest`** for testing smart contracts.

In the following chapters, we will:

- Design an example [**counter**](getting-started/counter.mdx) smart contract.
- [**Write tests**](getting-started/writing-tests.mdx) for the counter smart contract.
- Learn some [**best practices**](getting-started/best-practices.mdx) for testing with
  **`MultiTest`**.

The example **counter** smart contract and all test cases are provided in two versions: one using
pure CosmWasm libraries and the other using the Sylvia framework. The functionality of the
**counter** smart contract is identical in both versions.
