# Transactions

Every contract invocation is wrapped into a transaction. If you know about transactions in SQL
databases, you can consider them as the same basic concept. You execute multiple operations in a
single transaction, and if one of them fails, the whole transaction is rolled back.

In our case, these operations are invocations of contract entrypoints. If one of the invocations in
the chain fails, the whole transaction is usually rolled back. Failing in this context means that
the contract entrypoint returns an error or panics.

## Preventing rollbacks in case of failure

If you don't want your entire transaction to be rolled back in case of a failure, you can use the
`reply_on` field in the message you send. Set the field to one of the following values and instead
of rolling back the transaction, you will receive a message containing the error:

- `ReplyOn::Always`
- `ReplyOn::Error`

That way you can handle the error and decide what to do next, whether you want to propagate the
error, retry the operation, ignore it, etc.
