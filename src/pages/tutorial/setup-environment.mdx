# Environment setup

## Rust installation

To work with CosmWasm smart contract, you will need Rust installed on your machine. If you don't
have it, you can find installation instructions on
[the Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

I assume you are working with the stable Rust channel in this book.

Additionally, you will need the Wasm rust compiler backend installed to build Wasm binaries. To
install it, run:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## The cosmwasm-check utility

An additional helpful tool for building smart contracts is the
[`cosmwasm-check`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/tree/main/packages/check) utility. It allows
you to check if the wasm binary is a proper smart contract ready to upload into the blockchain. You
can install it using cargo:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo install cosmwasm-check
```

If the installation succeeds, you should be able to execute the utility from your command line.

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cosmwasm-check --version
```

The output should look like this:

```shell
Contract checking 1.2.3
```

## Verifying the installation

To guarantee you are ready to build your smart contracts, you need to make sure you can build
examples. Check out the [`cw-plus`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus) repository and run the
testing command in its folder:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
git clone git@github.com:CosmWasm/cw-plus.git && cd ./cw-plus && cargo test
```

You should see that everything in the repository gets compiled and all tests pass.

The [`cw-plus`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus) is a great place to find example contracts -
look for them in the `contracts` directory. The repository is maintained by CosmWasm creators, so
contracts in there should follow good practices.

To verify the [`cosmwasm-check`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/tree/main/packages/check)
utility, first, you need to build a smart contract. Go to some contract directory, for example,
`contracts/cw1-whitelist`, and call `cargo wasm`:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cd contracts/cw1-whitelist && cargo wasm
```

<Callout>
  Due to reference types feature enabled by default in the Rust compiler since version `1.82` it is
  required to use the previous Rust compiler releases until the CosmWasm `2.2` version is released.
  The CosmWasm `2.2` will enable support for the reference types.
</Callout>

You should be able to find your output binary in the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/` of the
root repo directory - not in the contract directory itself! Now you can check if contract validation
passes:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cosmwasm-check ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/
```

```shell
cw-plus/contracts/cw1-whitelist $ cosmwasm-check
../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw1_whitelist.wasm Available capabilities: {"iterator",
"cosmwasm_1_1", "cosmwasm_1_2", "stargate", "staking"}

../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw1_whitelist.wasm: pass

All contracts (1) passed checks!
```
