# Channel lifecycle

A channel is a connection between two IBC ports that allows them to send packets
to each other. In this section, we will cover how to establish a channel and how
to close it. Since a channel is a connection between two ports, it can connect
two chain modules, two contracts, or a module and a contract.

## Establishing a channel

In order to send packets between two chains, you need to establish a channel
between them. This process involves two calls per chain. They are described
below. Once the channel is established, you can start sending packets through
it, which we will cover in the next section.

### Channel open

{/* `ibc_channel_open` called on both chains, explain differences */}

### Channel connect

{/* `ibc_channel_connect` called on both chains, explain differences */}

## Closing a channel

Notes:

- reference basic concepts
- relayer initiates this
- explain ibc_channel_open & ibc_channel_connect
- since it's typical to store the counterparty channel upon connect
  explain security risks of not vetting port against allowlist
