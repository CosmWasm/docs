# ICS20: Fungible Token Transfer

The [ICS20] protocol defines a standard for transferring fungible tokens between two chains using
IBC. It is one of the most widely used IBC protocols and is supported by pretty much all chains in
the Cosmos.

To initiate an ICS20 transfer from inside a contract, you need to attach an `IbcMsg::Transfer`
message to your contract response like this:

```rust template="execute"
// construct the transfer message
let msg = IbcMsg::Transfer {
    channel_id: "channel-0".to_string(),
    to_address: "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    amount: Coin::new(123u128, "ucoin"),
    timeout: env.block.time.plus_seconds(60).into(),
    memo: None,
};

// attach the message and return the response
Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

Sending this message causes an IBC transfer of the given `amount` from your contract to the
destination chain at the other end of the given channel.

The `channel_id` is the identifier of the channel you want to use for the transfer. Which channel
that should be depends on the source and destination chain. You can find out the correct channel ID
using a [block explorer](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/relayers).

The `to_address` is the address on the _destination chain_ that should receive the tokens.

The `amount` is the number and denomination of tokens to send. On the destination chain, the same
amount will be received, but the denomination will be of the form `ibc/HASH`, where `HASH` is a
SHA256 hash uniquely identifying the channel and the source chain denomination. To learn more about
this, take a look at the [Cosmos Developer Portal].

The `timeout` can either be a timestamp or a block height, as measured on the destination chain. It
is used to prevent the transfer from being stuck in limbo if the destination chain does not receive
the packet.

The `memo` is an optional field that can be used to attach a message to the transfer. It is often
used for additional functionality like [packet-forward-middleware] or
[IBC Callbacks](./extensions/callbacks).
