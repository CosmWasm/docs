# Create a Rust project

The easiest and recommended way to start working on a new [Sylvia](https://crates.io/crates/sylvia)
contract is to generate it from the
[`sylvia-template`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/sylvia-template).

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo generate CosmWasm/sylvia-template
```

The [`sylvia-template`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/sylvia-template) will generate a lot of code for
you. Because this tutorial aims to guide you step-by-step through the process of creating your first
contract we will omit the use of the template and show you how to create it from the start.

## New project

Smart contracts are Rust library crates. We will start with creating one:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo new --lib ./contract
```

You created a simple Rust library, but it is not yet ready to be a smart contract. The first thing
to do is to update the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml copy filename="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "contract"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
sylvia = "1.3.1"
```

<Callout>
  Notice lack of `cosmwasm-std` dependency. Sylvia reexports it as well as other necessary crates
  for CosmWasm smart contracts. You can find list of reexported crates in the
  [documentation](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/#reexports).
</Callout>

As you can see, I added a `crate-type` field for the library section. Generating the
[`cdylib`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html) is required to create a proper web
assembly binary. The downside of this is that such a library cannot be used as a dependency for
other Rust crates - for now, it is not needed, but later we will show how to approach reusing
contracts as dependencies.

Additionally, we added a single dependency - [sylvia](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/). This
is the only dependency you need to start since [sylvia](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/)
reexports all the necessary crates for CosmWasm smart contracts. The most important reexported
crates are:

- [cosmwasm-std](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/) - Crate that is a standard
  library for smart contracts. It provides essential utilities for communication with the outside
  world, helper functions, and types. Every smart contract we will build will use this dependency.
- [schemars](https://docs.rs/schemars/latest/schemars/index.html) - Crate used to create JSON schema
  documents for our contracts. It is automatically derived on types generated by ^sylvia and will be
  later used to provide concise API for blockchain users, who might not be Rust developers.
- [cosmwasm-schema](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-schema/latest/cosmwasm_schema/) - Similar to
  `schemars`. This crate expands on `schemars` and provides us with trait
  [`QueryResponses`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-schema/latest/cosmwasm_schema/trait.QueryResponses.html)
  which ties query variants to their responses. I will expand on that later in the book.
- [serde](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/) - Framework for serializing and deserializing Rust
  data structures efficiently and generically.
