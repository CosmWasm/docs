# Testing KPIs

- Percentage of code coverage - **should be absolutely maximized** - until
  reaching 100%.
- Number of tests - **should be relatively minimized** - relatively, because the
  goal is not to have 1 test file with thousands lines of code, somewhat
  practical rule is TEST_LOC ≈ 2 \* SRC_LOC.

<Callout emoji="☠️" type="warning">
  Having 100% code coverage does not mean there are no logical errors in the
  code.
