# MultiTest

> A suite of tools (within the CosmWasm ecosystem) for testing multi-contract interactions,
> off-the-chain.

## Introduction

**`MultiTest`** is a suite of testing tools designed to facilitate multi-contract interactions
within the CosmWasm ecosystem. Its primary focus is on providing developers with a robust framework
for testing complex smart contract interactions and operations involving various Cosmos modules.

<Callout type="info" emoji="☉">
  **`MultiTest`** is a blockchain **SIMULATOR**, allowing tested smart contracts to interact as if
  they were operating on a real blockchain.
</Callout>

The most valuable advantage of using **`MultiTest`** is that it allows testing and debugging of
smart contracts with access to the Rust source code, eliminating the need to run a complete
blockchain node to begin designing the smart contract functionality. Additionally, **`MultiTest`**
enables the execution of tests significantly faster than on a real blockchain, as it bypasses the
overhead associated with network consensus and block production. This results in a more efficient
development cycle, allowing for quicker iterations and faster identification of issues.

While **`MultiTest`** is a blockchain **SIMULATOR**, it may happen, that the behavior of the real
blockchain might slightly differ in some edge cases. We strongly encourage you to [file an issue]
with a detailed description of such use case to help us improve the **`MultiTest`**.

In the upcoming chapters, we provide detailed instructions on installing and getting started with
**`MultiTest`**, writing unit tests for smart contracts, testing complex interactions between smart
contracts and testing smart contract interactions with Cosmos modules.

By the end of these chapters, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to use
**`MultiTest`** for testing and debugging smart contracts in various scenarios.

<Callout>
  To successfully follow the upcoming chapters, a basic knowledge of Rust and Cargo is necessary.
