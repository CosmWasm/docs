### `Cargo.toml`

```toml copy showLineNumbers filename="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "counter"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[features]
# use library feature to disable all instantiate/execute/query exports
library = []

[dependencies]
cosmwasm-schema = "2"
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2", features = ["cosmwasm_2_2"] }
cw-storage-plus = "2"
schemars = "0.8"
serde = "1.0"

[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = { version = "2", features = ["cosmwasm_2_2"] }
```

`Cargo.toml` file is a configuration file for a Rust project, in our case for a smart contract
written in Rust. Here's a detailed explanation of each section and what it's doing.

**\[package\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{1} filename="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "counter"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

- **`[package]`** section provides metadata about the Rust crate (smart contract library in our
  case).
- **`name = "counter"`** specifies the name of the crate, it's named **counter** like our smart
  contract.
- **`version = "0.1.0"`** indicates the current version of the package and the counter smart
  contract.
- **`edition = "2021"`** specifies the Rust edition being used; editions in Rust are sets of
  language and compiler improvements, with 2021 being one of the latest editions at the time,
  providing the latest features and enhancements.

**\[lib\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{8} filename="Cargo.toml"
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
```

- **`[lib]`** section specifies settings for building the library.
- **`crate-type`** enumerates types of libraries to be produced during compiling.
- **`"cdylib"`** specifies that the package will be compiled as a C-compatible dynamic library;
  which is required for smart contracts to run on the CosmWasm runtime.
- **`"rlib"`** specifies a Rust library file that can be used as a dependency for other Rust
  projects, in our case for other smart contracts.

**\[features\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{11} filename="Cargo.toml"
[features]
# use library feature to disable all instantiate/execute/query exports
library = []
```

- **`[features]`** section defines optional features for the Rust package.
- **`library = []`** defines a feature named **library**, which when set, disables exporting smart
  contract entry-points. Exporting entry points is necessary for interacting with the smart contract
  on the blockchain. However, when the contract is used as a dependency by other contracts,
  exporting these entry-points should be disabled to prevent unintended function name clashes.

**\[dependencies\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{15} filename="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
cosmwasm-schema = "2"
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2", features = ["cosmwasm_2_2"] }
cw-storage-plus = "2"
schemars = "0.8"
serde = "1.0"
```

- **`[dependencies]`** section lists the libraries that the package depends on.
- **`cosmwasm-schema`** is used for generating JSON schemas from Rust data structures, which is
  useful for documentation and ensuring compatibility of messages and queries.
- **`cosmwasm-std`** is the standard library for CosmWasm contracts, providing common types and
  utilities needed for interacting with the CosmWasm runtime.
- **`cw-storage-plus`** is a library that provides advanced storage abstractions and utilities on
  top of the basic storage capabilities in CosmWasm, making it easier to manage state within
  contracts.
- **`schemars`** is a library for generating JSON schemas, which complements `cosmwasm-schema` by
  providing additional features for schema generation.
- **`serde`** is a widely used serialization library in Rust, allowing easy conversion of Rust data
  structures to and from formats like JSON, which is crucial for data interchange in smart
  contracts.

**\[dev-dependencies\]**

```toml copy showLineNumbers{22} filename="Cargo.toml"
[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = { version = "2", features = ["cosmwasm_2_2"] }
```

- **`[dev-dependencies]`** section lists dependencies that are only needed for development and
  testing.
- **`cw-multi-test`** is a name of **`MultiTest`** library, and should **ALWAYS** be placed in
  **[dev-dependencies]** section.

Overall, this `Cargo.toml` file configures a Rust project for a CosmWasm-based smart contract. It
sets up the basic package details, specifies how the contract should be compiled, defines
dependencies for core functionality and testing, and includes features to enable or disable certain
parts of the contract code. This setup ensures the contract can be developed, tested, and deployed
effectively on the blockchain within the CosmWasm ecosystem.

### `lib.rs`

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="lib.rs"
pub mod contract;
pub mod msg;
```

The `lib.rs` file in a Rust project serves as the main entry point for defining the structure of a
library. In the context of our example **counter** smart contract, the `lib.rs` file is defining and
organizing the modules that make up the contract. Recall the **counter** project file structure:

```ansi {4,6} filename="counter (directory)"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ [34;1msrc[0m
    â”œâ”€â”€ contract.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
    â””â”€â”€ msg.rs
```

There are two modules in the project: `contract.rs` and `msg.rs`. That's why in the `lib.rs` file
there are two declarations:

- `pub mod contract;{:rust}`<br/> This line declares a public module named **contract**; tells Rust
  to include the code from a file named `contract.rs` located in the same directory and makes the
  module publicly accessible (`pub` keyword), which means that other modules or external code can
  access the entry-points of our smart contract.
- `pub mod msg;{:rust}`<br/> This line declares a public module named **msg**; includes the code
  from a file named `msg.rs` and also makes this module public which allows other parts of the code
  (especially our **counter** smart contract) to access the messages defined here.

Overall, this `lib.rs` file is setting up the main structure of the smart contract by defining its
key components as separate modules. This organization helps in keeping the code clean, modular, and
maintainable by separating the core contract logic (`contract.rs`) from the message and query
definitions (`msg.rs`). This modular approach makes the smart contract easier to understand, extend,
and test.

### `msg.rs`

The **msg** module in file `msg.rs` typically defines the messages and queries that the smart
contract accepts and responds to. Messages are usually structured as Rust enums or structs and
define the input and output interfaces of the contract. In our example this includes messages shown
below.

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="msg.rs"
use cosmwasm_schema::{cw_serde, QueryResponses};

#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterInitMsg {
    Zero,
    Set(u8),
}

#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterExecMsg {
    Inc,
    Dec,
    Set(u8),
}

#[cw_serde]
#[derive(QueryResponses)]
pub enum CounterQueryMsg {
    #[returns(CounterResponse)]
    Value,
}

#[cw_serde]
pub struct CounterResponse {
    pub value: u8,
}
```

Let's take a detailed look at the implementation of these messages.

#### Imports

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="msg.rs"
use cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde;
```

Required imports, like `cw_serde` annotation.

#### Instantiation message

This message is passed to `instantiate` entry-point.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{3} filename="msg.rs (CounterInitMsg)"
#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterInitMsg {
    Zero,
    Set(u8),
}
```

**`CounterInitMsg{:rust}`** enumeration is used to initialize the contract.
`CounterInitMsg::Zero{:rust}` variant initializes the counter with the zero value, and
`CounterInitMsg::Set{:rust}` variant initializes the counter with an arbitrary value in range 0
to 255. This message is passed to `instantiate{:rust}` entry-point of the counter smart contract.

#### Execution message

This message is passed to `execute` entry-point.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{9} filename="msg.rs (CounterExecMsg)"
#[cw_serde]
pub enum CounterExecMsg {
    Inc,
    Dec,
    Set(u8),
}
```

**`CounterExecMsg{:rust}`** enumeration is used to perform various actions within the contract,
especially incrementing (the `CounterExecMsg::Inc{:rust}` variant), decrementing (the
`CounterExecMsg::Dec{:rust}` variant) and setting an arbitrary counter value (the
`CounterExecMsg::Set{:rust}` variant). This message is passed to `execute{:rust}` entry-point of the
counter smart contract.

#### Query message

This message is passed to `query` entry-point.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{16} filename="msg.rs (CounterQueryMsg)"
#[cw_serde]
#[derive(QueryResponses)]
pub enum CounterQueryMsg {
    #[returns(CounterResponse)]
    Value,
}
```

**`CounterQueryMsg{:rust}`** enumeration, with its single variant `CounterQueryMsg::Value{:rust}` is
used to query the state of the contract, in our case to retrieve the current counter value. This
message is passed to `query{:rust}` entry-point of the counter smart contract. The
`#[derive(QueryResponses)]{:rust}` annotation informs the schema generator about the type of the
value returned by the query.

#### Response message

This message is returned from `query` entry-point and passed to the user.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{21} filename="msg.rs (CounterResponse)"
#[cw_serde]
pub struct CounterResponse {
    pub value: u8,
}
```

**`CounterResponse{:rust}`** struct with a single field `value{:rust}`, used to pass the responses
(results) from the queries.

Overall, the `msg.rs` file is basically setting up the contractâ€™s _social skills_, defining how it
interacts with the outside world by initializing, executing actions, and answering questions. Each
message type is a different way of communicating with the counter, making it an easy-going,
versatile smart contract, ready for action.

### `contract.rs`

Typically, in a smart contract project, the **contract** module (placed in the `contract.rs` file)
contains the core logic of the contract, including functions (entry-points) for instantiation,
execution, querying and migrating. This is where the main functionality of the smart contract is
implemented. And this is also the case for our **counter** smart contract. The full source code is
shown below.

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg(not(feature = "library"))]
use cosmwasm_std::entry_point;

use crate::msg::{CounterExecMsg, CounterInitMsg, CounterQueryMsg, CounterResponse};
use cosmwasm_std::{to_json_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdError};
use cw_storage_plus::Item;

const COUNTER: Item<u8> = Item::new("value");

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: CounterInitMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
    COUNTER.save(
        deps.storage,
        &match msg {
            CounterInitMsg::Zero => 0,
            CounterInitMsg::Set(new_value) => new_value,
        },
    )?;
    Ok(Response::default())
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: CounterExecMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
    COUNTER.update::<_, StdError>(deps.storage, |old_value| {
        Ok(match msg {
            CounterExecMsg::Inc => old_value.saturating_add(1),
            CounterExecMsg::Dec => old_value.saturating_sub(1),
            CounterExecMsg::Set(new_value) => new_value,
        })
    })?;
    Ok(Response::default())
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: CounterQueryMsg) -> Result<Binary, StdError> {
    match msg {
        CounterQueryMsg::Value => Ok(to_json_binary(&CounterResponse {
            value: COUNTER.may_load(deps.storage)?.unwrap(),
        })?),
    }
}
```

Let's take a detailed look at this implementation.

#### Conditional imports

```rust copy showLineNumbers filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg(not(feature = "library"))]
use cosmwasm_std::entry_point;
```

The import shown above is used for conditional compilation in CosmWasm smart contracts. It ensures
that the `entry_point` annotation is only included when the contract is being compiled as a
standalone WASM binary, not as a library. The `entry_point` annotation is essential for defining the
main functions of the smart contract, such as instantiate, execute, and query, which are responsible
for interacting with the contract. If you're using this smart contract in another project, this
configuration ensures that unnecessary code isn't included when compiling it as a library.

#### Imports

```rust copy showLineNumbers{4} filename="contract.rs"
use crate::msg::{CounterExecMsg, CounterInitMsg, CounterQueryMsg, CounterResponse};
use cosmwasm_std::{to_json_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdError};
use cw_storage_plus::Item;
```

These are additional imports required to compile the contract. The first `use{:rust}` statement
imports message structures for handling execution, initialization, and queries related to a
counter-based smart contract. The second `use{:rust}` imports essential tools and types from the
CosmWasm standard library, required for interacting with the blockchain environment, converting
data, and accessing dependencies. The third `use{:rust}` brings in the `Item{:rust}` type, which is
needed for storing single values in the contractâ€™s persistent storage.

#### Storage variable definition

```rust copy showLineNumbers{8} filename="contract.rs"
const COUNTER: Item<u8> = Item::new("value");
```

`COUNTER{:rust}` is a storage variable (although declared as `const{:rust}`) for a counter,
represented as an 8-bit unsigned integer. The `"value"{:rust}` string is the key used to store and
retrieve the counter value in the contract's persistent storage. This is used for tracking a counter
value that can be incremented, decremented, queried, or reset by the smart contract. More details
about the [Item](../../../cw-storage-plus/containers/item) type can be found in
[cw-storage-plus](../../../cw-storage-plus) documentation.

#### `instantiate` entry-point

The `instantiate{:rust}` function (entry-point) is called during the instantiation of the smart
contract. Depending on the value of the message passed in `msg{:rust}` argument, the counter will be
initialized with zero or with the value provided in `CounterInitMsg::Set{:rust}` variant. Using the
`COUNTER{:rust}` variable, the initial value is saved in the contract's persistent storage for
future use.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{10} filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: CounterInitMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
    COUNTER.save(
        deps.storage,
        &match msg {
            CounterInitMsg::Zero => 0,
            CounterInitMsg::Set(new_value) => new_value,
        },
    )?;
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

#### `execute` entry-point

The `execute{:rust}` function (entry-point) is called whenever the user wants to interact with the
contract, especially when the value of the counter should be incremented, decremented or reset.
Depending on the `msg{:rust}` value passed as an argument, the "old value" of the counter will be
incremented by one for `CounterExecMsg::Inc` variant, decremented by one for
`CounterExecMsg::Dec{:rust}` variant, or replaced with the new value for
`CounterExecMsg::Set{:rust}` variant. The new value will be saved in the contract's persistent
storage by calling `update{:rust}` function of the `COUNTER{:rust}` variable.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{27} filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: CounterExecMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
    COUNTER.update::<_, StdError>(deps.storage, |old_value| {
        Ok(match msg {
            CounterExecMsg::Inc => old_value.saturating_add(1),
            CounterExecMsg::Dec => old_value.saturating_sub(1),
            CounterExecMsg::Set(new_value) => new_value,
        })
    })?;
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

#### `query` entry-point

The `query{:rust}` function (entry-point) is called whenever the user asks the counter smart
contract for the current value. The counter value is retrieved from the contract's persistent
storage, wrapped with `CounterResponse{:rust}` type and returned to the user.

```rust copy showLineNumbers{44} filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: CounterQueryMsg) -> Result<Binary, StdError> {
    match msg {
        CounterQueryMsg::Value => Ok(to_json_binary(&CounterResponse {
            value: COUNTER.may_load(deps.storage)?.unwrap(),
        })?),
    }
}
```

## What next?

Having the **counter** smart contract prepared, you can begin writing tests using **`MultiTest`**,
or you might want to check the Sylvia version of the **counter** smart contract first.
