# Getting started

This unit is designed to help you quickly become familiar with the fundamental aspects of testing
CosmWasm smart contracts using **`MultiTest`**. It provides a practical example and best practices
to ensure a frictionless start with **`MultiTest`** for testing your smart contracts.

In the following chapters, you will find a [smart contract](getting-started/smart-contract.mdx)
example for which you will be [writing tests](getting-started/writing-tests.mdx), along with some
[best practices](getting-started/best-practices.mdx) for testing with **`MultiTest`**.

(todo: add the overview of the whole chapter when ready - with links)
