# Getting Started

The CosmWasm module leverages the [ibc-go](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/) implementation to
enable interaction with other blockchains through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.
With the release of ibc-go version 10, a new protocol
version—[IBCv2](https://ibcprotocol.dev/blog/ibc-v2-announcement)—was introduced. IBCv2 expands the
interoperability of the Cosmos ecosystem to include non-Cosmos blockchains. To support this broader
scope, the protocol team simplified the communication model and reduced the number of required entry
points. This streamlining makes it more practical to implement IBC support on chains such as
Ethereum. As a result, smart contract developers now need to implement only a few well-defined entry
points to fully harness cross-chain capabilities.

<Callout type="info">
To use IBCv2 entry points and messages in your smart contract, ensure that the `ibc2` feature is
enabled in your `cosmwasm-std` dependency. Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
cosmwasm-std = { version = "3.0", features = ["ibc2"] }
```

</Callout>

  This section of the documentation provides a basic overview of how to configure smart contracts to
  use IBCv2 entry points and communicate with services and contracts on other chains. For a deeper
  understanding of the IBC architecture, refer to the [official ibc-go
  documentation](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/).
