# Events attributes and data

The only way our contract can communicate with the world, for now, is through queries. Smart
contracts are passive - they cannot invoke any action by themselves. They can do it only as a
reaction to a call. But if you've ever tried playing with
[`wasmd`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd), you know that execution on the blockchain can return
some metadata.

There are two things the contract can return to the caller: events and data. Events are something
produced by almost every real-life smart contract. In contrast, data is rarely used, designed for
contract-to-contract communication.

## Returning events

As an example, we would add an event `admin_added` emitted by our contract on the execution of
`AddMembers`:

An event is built from two things: an event type provided in the
[`new`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.Event.html#method.new) function and
attributes. Attributes are added to an event with the
[`add_attributes`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.Event.html#method.add_attributes)
or the
[`add_attribute`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.Event.html#method.add_attribute)
call. Attributes are key-value pairs. Because an event cannot contain any list, to achieve reporting
multiple similar actions taking place, we need to emit multiple small events instead of a collective
one.

Events are emitted by adding them to the response with
[`add_event`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.Response.html#method.add_event)
or
[`add_events`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.Response.html#method.add_events)
call. Additionally, there is a possibility to add attributes directly to the response. It is just
sugar. By default, every execution emits a standard "wasm" event. Adding attributes to the result
adds them to the default event.

We can check if events are properly emitted by contract. It is not always done, as it is much of
boilerplate in test, but events are, generally, more like logs - not necessarily considered main
contract logic. Let's now write single test checking if execution emits events:

```rust {43-76} filename="src/contract.rs"
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use cw_multi_test::{App, ContractWrapper, Executor, IntoAddr};

    use crate::msg::AdminsListResp;

    use super::*;

    // ...

    #[test]
    fn add_members() {
        let mut app = App::default();

        let code = ContractWrapper::new(execute, instantiate, query);
        let code_id = app.store_code(Box::new(code));
        let owner = "owner".into_addr();

        let addr = app
            .instantiate_contract(
                code_id,
                owner.clone(),
                &InstantiateMsg {
                    admins: vec![owner.to_string()],
                },
                &[],
                "Contract",
                None,
            )
            .unwrap();

        let resp = app
            .execute_contract(
                owner.clone(),
                addr,
                &ExecuteMsg::AddMembers {
                    admins: vec![owner.to_string()],
                },
                &[],
            )
            .unwrap();

        let wasm = resp.events.iter().find(|ev| ev.ty == "wasm").unwrap();
        assert_eq!(
            wasm.attributes
                .iter()
                .find(|attr| attr.key == "action")
                .unwrap()
                .value,
            "add_members"
        );
        assert_eq!(
            wasm.attributes
                .iter()
                .find(|attr| attr.key == "added_count")
                .unwrap()
                .value,
            "1"
        );

        let admin_added: Vec<_> = resp
            .events
            .iter()
            .filter(|ev| ev.ty == "wasm-admin_added")
            .collect();
        assert_eq!(admin_added.len(), 1);

        assert_eq!(
            admin_added[0]
                .attributes
                .iter()
                .find(|attr| attr.key == "addr")
                .unwrap()
                .value,
            owner.to_string()
        );
    }
}
```

As you can see, testing events on a simple test made it clunky. First of all, every event is heavily
string-based - a lack of type control makes writing such tests difficult. Also, event types are
prefixed with "wasm-" - it may not be a huge problem, but it doesn't clarify verification. But the
problem is how layered the structure of events is, which makes verifying them tricky. Also, the
"wasm" event is particularly tricky, as it contains an implied attribute - `_contract_addr`
containing the address that called the contract. My general rule is - do not test emitted events
unless some logic depends on them.

## Data

Besides events, any smart contract execution may produce a `data` object. In contrast to events,
`data` can be structured. It makes it a way better choice to perform any communication the logic
relies on. On the other hand, it turns out it is very rarely helpful outside of contract-to-contract
communication. Data is always a singular object within the response, and it's set with the
[`set_data`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.Response.html#method.set_data)
function. Because of its low usefulness in a single contract environment, we will not spend time on
it right now - an example of it will be covered later when contract-to-contract communication will
be discussed. Until then, it is just helpful to know such an entity exists.
