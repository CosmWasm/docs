# Installation

## Setting up the environment

Before diving right into writing code, you need to install some tooling in order
to compile your contract.

CosmWasm is luckily rather self-contained and therefore needs little external
tooling to compile.  
Our only external dependency is Rust, which you need to install for your
platform.

<Callout>
  We recommend installing Rust using the official [rustup
  installer](https://rustup.rs). This makes it easy to stay on the most recent
  Rust version and to install compiler targets.
</Callout>

  For production builds you probably also want to install
  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), too.
  <br /> This is because we offer the [CosmWasm Optimizing Compiler](https://github.com/CosmWasm/optimizer),
  which uses a Docker image to build the smallest contract possible in a deterministic
  fashion.
</Callout>

After installing Rust, you need to add the WebAssembly target. This is needed so
Rust knows how to build your code to WebAssembly.

To install the target using `rustup`, run the following command:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Perfect!  
Now that we set up the foundation we just need two more tools:

1. `cargo-generate`
2. `cargo-run-script` (this is required to later optimize your contract for
   production)

To install those, run the following commands:

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

## Setting up the contract

Now that the environment is all done, let's create the project!

Luckily you don't need to start from scratch, we already took care of the most
tedious parts of setting up a new project in form of a template!

In order to generate a fresh project, run this command and off we go:

<Callout>
  Make sure to change `PROJECT_NAME` to the name of your contract!
</Callout>

```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template.git --name PROJECT_NAME
```

Now you should have a ready contract project in a new folder called
`PROJECT_NAME` (or whatever you changed it to).
