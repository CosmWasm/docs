# MultiTest

## Introduction

**`MultiTest`** is a testing tool designed to facilitate multi-contract interactions within the
CosmWasm ecosystem. Its primary focus is on providing developers with a robust framework for
off-chain testing of complex smart contract interactions and operations involving various Cosmos
modules.

<Callout type="info" emoji="☉">
  **`MultiTest`** is a blockchain **SIMULATOR**, allowing tested smart contracts to interact as if
  they were operating on a real blockchain.
</Callout>

The most valuable advantages of using **`MultiTest`** is that it allows for testing and debugging
smart contracts with access to the Rust source code and eliminates the need to run a complete
blockchain node to begin designing the functionality of the contract. Additionally, **`MultiTest`**
enables the execution of tests significantly faster than on a real blockchain, as it bypasses the
overhead associated with network consensus and block production. This results in a more efficient
development cycle, allowing for quicker iterations and faster identification of issues, even before
the smart contract is deployed on the blockchain.

While **`MultiTest`** is a blockchain simulator, it may happen, that the behavior of the real
blockchain might slightly differ in some edge cases. We strongly encourage you to [file an issue]
with a detailed description of such use case to help us improve the **`MultiTest`**.

In the upcoming chapters, we provide detailed instructions on installing and getting started with
**`MultiTest`**, writing integration tests for smart contracts, testing complex interactions between
smart contracts, and testing smart contract interactions with several Cosmos modules.

By the end of these chapters, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to use
**`MultiTest`** for testing and debugging smart contracts in various scenarios.

<Callout>
  To successfully follow the upcoming chapters, a basic knowledge of [Rust and Cargo] is necessary.
