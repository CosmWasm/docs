# `App`

The [App] struct in **`MultiTest`** represents the blockchain simulator. Creating `App{:rust}`
mimics the startup of a real-life blockchain within tests that utilize **`MultiTest`**.

## `default`

The most straightforward way to create the `App{:rust}` is by using the `default` method, which is
the equivalent of calling the `new` constructor with an empty initialization callback.

```rust showLineNumbers copy /default/
use cw_multi_test::App;

let app = App::default();
```

```rust showLineNumbers copy /new/
use cw_multi_test::{no_init, App};

let app = App::new(no_init);
```

In both cases, the newly created `App{:rust}` object simulates a blockchain with the default
settings, as summarized in [Features summary](features#features-summary).

## `new`
