# Entry Points in IBCv2

IBCv2 introduces four primary entry points for smart contracts interacting via the Inter-Blockchain
Communication protocol. These entry points define how contracts handle incoming packets, timeouts,
acknowledgements, and outbound messages. Each of these entry points plays a critical role in
enabling robust, verifiable, and asynchronous cross-chain communication between smart contracts via
IBCv2.

## Receive Entry Point

```rust template="core"
#[entry_point]
pub fn ibc2_packet_receive(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    msg: Ibc2PacketReceiveMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcReceiveResponse> {
    // [...]
    Ok(IbcReceiveResponse::default())
}
```

The `ibc2_packet_receive` function is invoked when an IBCv2 packet is received on a port ID
associated with the contract instance. The `Ibc2PacketReceiveMsg` includes:

- The packet payload data
- The relayer address
- The source client ID
- The unique packet sequence number

This entry point allows the contract to process incoming cross-chain messages.

There are two options for sending acknowledgements:

- Send a synchronous acknowledgement immediately using, for example,
  `IbcReceiveResponse::new(StdAck::success(b"\x01"))`.
- Defer the acknowledgement for
  [asynchronous processing](message-passing#asynchronous-acknowledgements) using
  `IbcReceiveResponse::without_ack()`.

## Timeout Entry Point

```rust template="core"
#[entry_point]
pub fn ibc2_packet_timeout(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    msg: Ibc2PacketTimeoutMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    // [...]
    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::default())
}
```

This function is triggered when a packet sent by the contract is proven not to have been received or
processed by the destination chain. It serves as a fallback mechanism in case of connection issues.
The `Ibc2PacketTimeoutMsg` provides:

- The original packet payload
- Source and destination client IDs
- The packet sequence number
- The relayer address

## Acknowledgement Entry Point

```rust template="core"
#[entry_point]
pub fn ibc2_acknowledge_receive(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    msg: Ibc2PacketAckMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    // [...]
    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::default())
}
```

When an acknowledgement for a previously sent packet is received, this entry point is called. The
`Ibc2PacketAckMsg` contains:

- Source and destination client IDs
- The relayer address
- The acknowledgement response data
- The payload of the original packet

This allows the contract to confirm and act upon the acknowledgement of a sent message.

## Send Entry Point

```rust template="core"
#[entry_point]
pub fn ibc2_packet_send(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    msg: Ibc2PacketSendMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    // [...]
    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::default())
}
```

To support permissionless packet sending, IBCv2 introduces the `ibc2_packet_send` entry point. This
function allows the contract to validate outbound messages initiated from its associated port. The
`Ibc2PacketSendMsg` includes:

- Source and destination client IDs
- Packet sequence number
- Signer address
- Message payload
