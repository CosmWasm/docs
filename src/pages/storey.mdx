# Introduction

[Storey](https://docs.rs/cw-storey/latest/cw_storey/) is an alternative to
[StoragePlus](cw-storage-plus) and fulfills the same purpose. The
[StoragePlus introduction](cw-storage-plus) could very well be transplanted
here, verbatim - feel free to give it a read if you're not sure what this
software does.

While StoragePlus has been around for years and is the established way of
storing your data on-chain, Storey is the new kid on the block.

Storey is currently **prototype software**, meaning the API might change
rapidly, **storage layout might break between versions**, and you might stumble
into bugs and missing features. It's probably a good idea not to use it for
serious production software just yet. If you do, please keep in mind the
increased maintenance burden and be careful!

On the other hand, it is a solution we want to move toward - we appreciate
anyone willing to help us test it. We also appreciate feedback, feature
requests, and bug reports.

If you decide to give this a try, kudos to you!
