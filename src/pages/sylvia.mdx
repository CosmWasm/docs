# Introduction to Sylvia

[`Sylvia`](https://github.com/cosmwasm/sylvia) is a framework for building CosmWasm smart contracts
with a high level of abstraction.

It's built on top of crates such as [`cosmwasm-std`](https://crates.io/crates/cosmwasm-std) and
[`cw-multi-test`](https://crates.io/crates/cw-multi-test).

<Callout>Sylvia contracts are fully interoperable with regular CosmWasm contracts</Callout>

It allows the users to focus purely on business logic by generating message structures, specifying
how their API is (de)serialized, or how to handle message dispatching. Instead, the API of your
contract is a set of traits you implement on your contract type.

The framework generates things like entry point structures, functions dispatching the messages, or
even helpers for [`MultiTest`](../cw-multi-test). It allows for better control of interfaces,
including validating their completeness at compile time.

Sylvia consists of two crates:

- [`sylvia`](https://crates.io/crates/sylvia) - Crate the users should use. Exposes all of the
  macros from the `sylvia-derive` and provides some additional utilities.
- [`sylvia-derive`](https://crates.io/crates/sylvia-derive) - Contains all of the Sylvia macros. Do
  not add this as a dependency on your contract.

While using Sylvia consider using reexported crates like `cosmwasm-std` and `cw-multi-test` instead
of adding those dependencies yourself as this would lead you to smaller dependencies to maintain.

You can visit [`docs.rs`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/) to learn about the types exposed in
the Sylvia.
