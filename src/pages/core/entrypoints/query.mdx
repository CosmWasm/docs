# Query

In the previous section we talked about the [`execute` endpoint]. The `query` endpoint is actually
pretty similar to its sibling `execute`, but with one key difference: The storage is only accessible
immutably.

This means you can only _read_ from the storage but not _write_ to it.

## Properly defining a message

When defining a message for queries, you always return some value. To properly document these return
values, you'll want to define them in your schema.

This is where the `cosmwasm_schema::QueryResponses` derive macro comes in.

```rust filename="contract.rs"
#[cw_serde]
struct GreetResponse {
  message: String,
}

#[cw_serde]
struct GoodbyeResponse {
  message: String,
}

#[cw_serde]
#[derive(QueryResponses)]
enum CustomQueryMsg {
  #[returns(GreetResponse)]
  Greet,
  #[returns(GoodbyeResponse)]
  Goodbye,
}
```

The macro then defines the required code to document the responses in your code properly so you can
easily generate, for example, TypeScript types for your contract clients.

## Definition

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(
    _deps: Deps,
    _env: Env,
    _msg: QueryMsg,
) -> StdResult<QueryResponse> {
  Ok(QueryResponse::default())
}
```

[`execute` endpoint]: ./execute.mdx
