# Reply

The `reply` endpoint is another special one.

It relates to CosmWasm's actor model which dictates how you call other contracts
and interact with them.

<Callout>
  If you are not familiar with the actor model, you can find out more about it
  on [its own page].
</Callout>

This endpoint gets invoked when you receive a response to a message you sent out
over the chain. The reply parameter then allows you to inspect and work with the
response that was produced.

## Request a reply

To request a reply, you need to use the `reply_on` field in the message you send
and set it to one of the following values:

- `ReplyOn::Always`
- `ReplyOn::Error`
- `ReplyOn::Success`

<Callout>
  The `reply_on` value has an impact on when a transaction is cancelled. For
  more info, check the page about [transactions].
</Callout>

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
const CONTRACT_ADDR: &str = "other_contract";
const SUBMSG_ID: u64 = 1; // This is a unique identifier so we can associate a reply with a specific submessage. It can be any numeric value.

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: cosmwasm_std::Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    if msg.id != SUBMSG_ID {
        return Err(StdError::generic_err("Invalid submsg id"));
    }

    // We received a message! From the contract we invoked earlier.

    Ok(Response::default())
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: ExecuteMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
    let msg = WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: CONTRACT_ADDR.into(),
        msg: to_json_binary(&OtherContractMsg::DoSomething {}).unwrap(),
        funds: vec![],
    };

    let submsg = SubMsg::reply_always(msg, SUBMSG_ID);
    Ok(Response::new().add_submessage(submsg))
}
```
