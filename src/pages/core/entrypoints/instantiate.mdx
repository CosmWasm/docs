# Instantiate

This is one of the most fundamental entrypoints. This entrypoint is called once during the contract
lifecycle.  
It essentially is there to initialise the state of your contract (for example, initialising a
counter in storage, etc.).

You can imagine it as the constructor of your contract.

<Callout>
    Note that this function is called for *each instance* of your contract 
    that you decide to create, not one time ever.

    To equate it to OOP, your contract is a *class*, and this is the *constructor*,
    and you can have *multiple instances* of the same class, and the constructor
    is called once for every one of these instances.

    It is **not** a singleton.

</Callout>

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    _msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // TODO: Initialise storage, send out metrics, do mischief
    Ok(Response::new())
}
```
