# Interact via the CLI

## Upload

In this section, you will upload a WASM contract to the blockchain. This involves using the
`wasmd tx wasm store` command to upload the contract file, and then querying the blockchain to
obtain the unique code ID for the uploaded contract.

### Upload code

You can upload your contract by running the command: `wasmd tx wasm store`. In the following
example, we upload the `hackatom.wasm` contract:

```sh
wasmd tx wasm store "./x/wasm/keeper/testdata/hackatom.wasm" \
  --from alice \
  --gas 1500000 \
  -y \
  --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
  -o json \
  --keyring-backend=test
```

- `./x/wasm/keeper/testdata/hackatom.wasm` is the path to the WASM file to upload
- `--from alice` specifies the sender's account, in this case, `alice`
- `--gas 1500000` sets the gas limit for the transaction
- `-y` automatically accepts the transaction
- `--chain-id=docs-chain-1` specifies the chain ID of the blockchain
- `-o json` outputs the result in JSON format
- `--keyring-backend=test` specifies the keyring backend to use

The output looks like:

```json
{
  "height": "0",
  "txhash": "57514909E7654EE7A1F90036ABDBDFF0B411C43ECC32315CD7759894337B6C4F",
  "codespace": "",
  "code": 0,
  "data": "",
  "raw_log": "",
  "logs": [],
  "info": "",
  "gas_wanted": "0",
  "gas_used": "0",
  "tx": null,
  "timestamp": "",
  "events": []
}
```

From this output, we can get the transaction hash `txhash`. Using this hash, we can fetch the code
ID.

```sh
wasmd q tx 2C19314D369E7EF3C77CBD1B33E02DB0401619B5C8E1B1E5BD15AB46C3704E96 -o json
```

Output:

```json
{
  ...
  "events": [
    ...
    {
      "type": "store_code",
      "attributes": [
        {
          "key": "code_checksum",
          "value": "3f4cd47c39c57fe1733fb41ed176eebd9d5c67baf5df8a1eeda1455e758f8514",
          "index": true
        },
        {
          "key": "code_id",
          "value": "1",
          "index": true
        },
        {
          "key": "msg_index",
          "value": "0",
          "index": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Inside the `store_code` event, you can find the `code_id`. To extract it, you can use the following
command:

```sh
RESP=$(wasmd q tx 2C19314D369E7EF3C77CBD1B33E02DB0401619B5C8E1B1E5BD15AB46C3704E96 -o json)
echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.events[]| select(.type=="store_code").attributes[]| select(.key=="code_id").value'
```

Below is the full script that uploads the code and fetches the code ID:

```sh
# Upload the contract
RESP=$(wasmd tx wasm store "./x/wasm/keeper/testdata/hackatom.wasm" \
  --from alice \
  --gas 1500000 \
  -y \
  --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
  -o json \
  --keyring-backend=test)

# Wait for the transaction to be processed
sleep 6

# Fetch the transaction details
RESP=$(wasmd q tx $(echo "$RESP"| jq -r '.txhash') -o json)

# Extract the code ID
CODE_ID=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.events[]| select(.type=="store_code").attributes[]| select(.key=="code_id").value')

# Print code id
echo "* Code id: $CODE_ID"
```

### Query Code ID Metadata

To query the metadata of a specific code ID, use the following command:

```sh
wasmd q wasm code-info $CODE_ID -o json
```

Output:

```json
{
  "code_id": "1",
  "creator": "wasm1zxevglcy90hq49x8vvdckfrgd9ffndxf70ut0z",
  "data_hash": "3F4CD47C39C57FE1733FB41ED176EEBD9D5C67BAF5DF8A1EEDA1455E758F8514",
  "instantiate_permission": {
    "permission": "Everybody",
    "addresses": []
  }
}
```

- Code ID: This is the reference to the stored WASM code
- Creator: This is the address of the account that uploaded the code
- Data Hash: This is the checksum of the stored WASM code
- Instantiate Permission: This is the instantiate permission configuration. It is optional, and the
  default value is `Everybody`, which means everybody can create an instance of the uploaded WASM
  code

### Download code

You can download the code associated with a specific code ID by running the following command:

```sh
wasmd q wasm code $CODE_ID downloaded_code.wasm
```

This command retrieves the WASM code from the blockchain and saves it to a file named
`downloaded_code.wasm`.

## Instantiation

In this section, you will create a new instance of the uploaded WASM contract. This involves using
the `wasmd tx wasm instantiate` command to instantiate the contract, and then querying the
blockchain to obtain the contract's address.

### Create a new contract instance

First, set up the addresses for the accounts involved in the contract using `wasmd keys show`
command:

```sh
# Retrieve the address of Alice's account
ALICE_ADDR=$(wasmd keys show alice -a --keyring-backend=test)

# Retrieve the address of Bob's account
BOB_ADDR=$(wasmd keys show bob -a --keyring-backend=test)

# Define init parameters fo the contract
INIT="{\"verifier\":\"$ALICE_ADDR\", \"beneficiary\":\"$BOB_ADDR\"}"
```

Run the following command to instantiate the contract:

```sh
wasmd tx wasm instantiate "$CODE_ID" "$INIT" \
  --admin="$ALICE_ADDR" \
  --from alice \
  --amount="100stake" \
  --label "local0.1.0" \
  --gas 1000000 \
  -y \
  --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
  -o json \
  --keyring-backend=test
```

- `wasmd tx wasm instantiate "$CODE_ID" "$INIT"` instantiates the contract using the specified code
  ID and initial parameters
- `--admin="$ALICE_ADDR"` specifies Alice as the admin who can later update the contract
- `--from alice` specifies Alice as the sender of the transaction
- `--amount="100stake"`: Sends `100 stake` to the contract upon instantiation
- `--label "local0.1.0"` assigns a label to this contract instance for easy identification
- `--gas 1000000` sets the gas limit for the transaction
- `-y` automatically accepts the transaction without prompting for confirmation
- `--chain-id=docs-chain-1` specifies the chain ID of the blockchain
- `-o json` outputs the result in JSON format
- `--keyring-backend=test` specifies the keyring backend to use

### Query the Contract Address

To retrieve the address of the newly instantiated contract you can use
`wasmd query wasm list-contract-by-code` command:

```sh
wasmd query wasm list-contract-by-code "$CODE_ID" -o json
```

The output lists all contracts instantiated from the specified code ID:

```json
{
  "contracts": ["wasm1suhgf5svhu4usrurvxzlgn54ksxmn8gljarjtxqnapv8kjnp4nrss5maay"],
  "pagination": {
    "next_key": null,
    "total": "0"
  }
}
```

Below is the full script that combines all the steps:

```sh
# Set up addresses
ALICE_ADDR=$(wasmd keys show alice -a --keyring-backend=test)
BOB_ADDR=$(wasmd keys show bob -a --keyring-backend=test)
INIT="{\"verifier\":\"$ALICE_ADDR\", \"beneficiary\":\"$BOB_ADDR\"}"

# Instantiate the contract
RESP=$(wasmd tx wasm instantiate "$CODE_ID" "$INIT" \
  --admin="$ALICE_ADDR" \
  --from alice \
  --amount="100stake" \
  --label "local0.1.0" \
  --gas 1000000 \
  -y \
  --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
  -o json \
  --keyring-backend=test)

# Wait for the transaction to be processed
sleep 6

# Query the contract address
CONTRACT=$(wasmd query wasm list-contract-by-code "$CODE_ID" -o json | jq -r '.contracts[-1]')

# Print the contract address
echo "* Contract address: $CONTRACT"
```

### Query Contract Metadata

To query the metadata of a specific contract, use the following command:

```sh
wasmd q wasm contract $CONTRACT -o json
```

Output:

```json
{
  "address": "wasm14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s0phg4d",
  "contract_info": {
    "code_id": "1",
    "creator": "wasm1zxevglcy90hq49x8vvdckfrgd9ffndxf70ut0z",
    "admin": "wasm1zxevglcy90hq49x8vvdckfrgd9ffndxf70ut0z",
    "label": "local0.1.0",
    "created": {
      "block_height": "787",
      "tx_index": "0"
    },
    "ibc_port_id": "",
    "extension": null
  }
}
```

- Address: This is the address of the contract on the blockchain. It uniquely identifies the
  contract and is used for interacting with it.
- Code ID: This is the reference to the stored WASM code from which the contract was instantiated.
- Creator: This is the blockchain address of the account that initially instantiated the contract.
  It indicates who created the contract instance.
- Admin: This is the address of the account that has administrative privileges over the contract,
  such as the ability to execute migrations. This field is optional and can be set during
  instantiation.
- Label: This is an optional field used to give a human-readable label to the contract. It helps in
  identifying the contract instance, especially when multiple instances of the same code are
  deployed.
- Created: This section provides details about the transaction in which the contract was
  instantiated, including the block height at which the contract was created and the index of the
  transaction within the block.
- IBC Port ID: This is the Port ID for Inter-Blockchain Communication [IBC](../../ibc.mdx). If the
  contract is set up to interact with other blockchains via IBC, this field will contain the
  relevant port ID.
- Extention: This is is an extension point to store custom metadata within the persistence model

## Instantiation with Predictable Address

### Create a new contract instance with predictable address

```sh
RESP=$(wasmd tx wasm instantiate2 "$CODE_ID" "$INIT" 10 \
  --admin="$ALICE_ADDR" \
  --from alice \
  --amount="100stake" \
  --label "local0.1.0" \
  --fix-msg \
  --gas 1000000 \
  -y \
  --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
  -b sync \
  -o json \
  --keyring-backend=test)

sleep 6

CONTRACT_PREDICTABLE=$(wasmd query wasm list-contract-by-code "$CODE_ID" -o json | jq -r '.contracts[-1]')

# Print contract address
echo "* Predictable contract address: $CONTRACT_PREDICTABLE"
```

### Query contracts by code id

You can get a list of contracts instantiated from a specific Code ID, by running the following
command:

```sh
wasmd q wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID
```

### Query contracts by creator

You can get a list of contracts instantiated from a specific creator, by running the following
command:

```sh
wasmd q wasm list-contracts-by-creator $ALICE_ADDR
```

## Execution

### Execute a command on a wasm contract

To execute a command on a wasm contract you can run the following commands:

```sh
echo "## Execute contract $CONTRACT"

MSG='{"release":{}}'

RESP=$(wasmd tx wasm execute "$CONTRACT" "$MSG" \
  --from alice \
  --gas 1000000 \
  -y \
  --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
  -b sync \
  -o json \
  --keyring-backend=test)

sleep 6

wasmd q tx $(echo "$RESP"| jq -r '.txhash') -o json | jq
```

### Query contract state

```sh
wasmd query wasm contract-state all "$CONTRACT" -o json | jq -r '.models[0].value' | base64 -d | jq
```

## Migration

### Migrate a wasm contract to a new code version

```sh
echo "## Migrate contract"
echo "### Upload new code"

RESP=$(wasmd tx wasm store "./x/wasm/keeper/testdata/burner.wasm" \
  --from alice \
  --gas 1100000 \
  -y \
  --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
  --node=http://localhost:26657 \
  -b sync \
  -o json \
  --keyring-backend=test)

sleep 6

RESP=$(wasmd q tx $(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.txhash') -o json)
BURNER_CODE_ID=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.events[] | select(.type=="store_code").attributes[] | select(.key=="code_id").value')

echo "### Migrate to code id: $BURNER_CODE_ID"

DEST_ACCOUNT=$(wasmd keys show bob -a --keyring-backend=test)

RESP=$(wasmd tx wasm migrate "$CONTRACT" "$BURNER_CODE_ID" "{\"payout\": \"$DEST_ACCOUNT\"}" \
  --from alice \
  --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
  -b sync \
  -y \
  -o json \
  --keyring-backend=test)

sleep 6

wasmd q tx $(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.txhash') -o json | jq
```

### Query contract history

You can query the history entries for a contract by running the following command:

```sh
wasmd q wasm contract-history $CONTRACT -o json | jq
```

Output:

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "operation": "CONTRACT_CODE_HISTORY_OPERATION_TYPE_INIT",
      "code_id": "1",
      "updated": {
        "block_height": "787",
        "tx_index": "0"
      },
      "msg": {
        "verifier": "wasm1zxevglcy90hq49x8vvdckfrgd9ffndxf70ut0z",
        "beneficiary": "wasm1xxt02kmatpk5gwhmkrnpql02mfe0h4zcqvqeg0"
      }
    },
    {
      "operation": "CONTRACT_CODE_HISTORY_OPERATION_TYPE_MIGRATE",
      "code_id": "2",
      "updated": {
        "block_height": "1718",
        "tx_index": "0"
      },
      "msg": {
        "payout": "wasm1xxt02kmatpk5gwhmkrnpql02mfe0h4zcqvqeg0"
      }
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_key": null,
    "total": "0"
  }
}
```

### Set contract admin

The admin is the only address that can migrate a contract. The admin can be updated by the current
admin with the following command. In this case, the admin is updated from Alice's address to Bob's
address.

```sh
wasmd tx wasm set-contract-admin \
  "$CONTRACT" \
  "$BOB_ADDR" \
  --from alice \
  --keyring-backend=test \
  --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
  -y
```

### Clear contract admin

You can clear the admin address from a contract. This action prevents any further migration.

```sh
wasmd tx wasm clear-contract-admin \
  "$CONTRACT" \
  --from alice \
  --keyring-backend=test \
  --chain-id=docs-chain-1 \
  -y
```
