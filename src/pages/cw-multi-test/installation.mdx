# Installation

## It's a Rust library

**`MultiTest`** ships as a **Rust library** named [cw-multi-test].

To use **`MultiTest`** in your project, add it as a **DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCY**:

```toml filename="Cargo.toml" copy
[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = "2"
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨">
  **`MultiTest`** is a **TESTING** library and should always be added to your project as
  **DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCY** in section **`[dev-dependencies]`** of the **Cargo.toml** file.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="ðŸ›‘">
  **`MultiTest`** is **NOT** designed to be used in production code on real-life blockchain.
</Callout>

## Prerequisities

### Rust and Cargo

The only prerequisite to test CosmWasm smart contracts using **`MultiTest`** is having [Rust
and Cargo] installed.

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend installing Rust using the official [rustup installer]. This makes it easy to stay on
  the most recent version of Rust.
</Callout>

### Tarpaulin and Nextest

Optionally, you may want to install [Tarpaulin] for measuring code coverage, and [Nextest] for
running tests faster with clean and beautiful user interface.

Installing **Tarpaulin**:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

Installing **Nextest**:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo install cargo-nextest
```
