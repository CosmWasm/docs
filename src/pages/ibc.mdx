# Introduction

IBC is a protocol that allows different blockchains to communicate with each
other. It is a standard that defines how blockchains can send and receive
messages to each other. This allows for the creation of a network of blockchains
that can interact with each other.

You can use the IBC protocol as a building block to create your own custom
protocols on top of it, but you can also use existing protocols like the [ICS 20
token transfer protocol]. In the following sections, we will explain how both of
these work.
