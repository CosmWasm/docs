# ADR-8: IBC Callbacks

If you send an IBC packet from a contract, you'll get an acknowledgement of receipt or timeout in
the respective handler (see [Packet lifecycle][packet-lifecycle] for more details). This is great,
but what if you want to get notified on completion of IBC packets you did not send directly from the
contract, but that were caused by a message you sent? One real-world use-case of this is
[ICS20](../ics20) transfers. When you send an ICS20 transfer message, the transfer module on the
chain sends an IBC packet, but you do not get any feedback on whether the transfer was successful or
not and the destination does not get informed of its newfound wealth.

To solve this problem, the [ADR-8 specification][adr-8] was created. On the source chain, it
provides callbacks when an IBC packet was acknowledged or timed out. On the destination chain, it
triggers callbacks when a packet is received.

IBC Callbacks is a generalized successor of [IBC Hooks][ibc-hooks] that works not just for ICS20
transfers, but any message that supports the required interface.

<Callout>
  To receive callbacks, the chain needs to support IBC Callbacks for the message type.
</Callout>

## Enabling IBC Callbacks for a message

You need to explicitly opt-in to IBC Callbacks for each message. In order to do this, you need to
add some metadata to the message, including who should receive the callbacks.

<Callout>
  The exact data format and how to add it to the message can vary, but for the `IbcMsg::Transfer`
  message, this data is in JSON format and needs to be added to the `memo` field.
</Callout>

To make this as easy as possible, we provide two ways to generate the correct JSON. One is a builder
type for the `IbcMsg::Transfer` type which provides a type-safe way to generate the complete
`IbcMsg::Transfer`, the other is a helper type [`IbcCallbackRequest`] that just generates the JSON
for the `memo` field:

[`IbcCallbackRequest`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.IbcCallbackRequest.html

<Tabs items={['TransferMsgBuilder (recommended)', 'IbcCallbackRequest']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>

```rust template="execute"
let msg = TransferMsgBuilder::new(
    "channel-0".to_string(),
    "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    Coin::new(10u32, "ucoin"),
    Timestamp::from_seconds(12345),
)
.with_src_callback(IbcSrcCallback {
    address: env.contract.address,
    gas_limit: None,
})
.with_dst_callback(IbcDstCallback {
    address: "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    gas_limit: None,
})
.build();

Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>

```rust template="execute"
let msg = IbcMsg::Transfer {
    channel_id: "channel-0".to_string(),
    to_address: "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    amount: Coin::new(10u32, "ucoin"),
    timeout: Timestamp::from_seconds(12345).into(),
    memo: Some(to_json_string(&IbcCallbackRequest::both(IbcSrcCallback {
        address: env.contract.address,
        gas_limit: None,
    }, IbcDstCallback {
        address: "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
        gas_limit: None,
    })).unwrap()),
};

Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

    </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

As you can see, you can request callbacks for both the source and destination chain. However, you
can also request callbacks for only one of them. For this, you need to provide the address that
should receive the callback and you can optionally set a gas limit for the callback execution.
Please take a look at the `IbcCallbackRequest` docs for more information.

<Callout>
  The `address` of the source callback always needs to be the contract address that sends the
  message (`env.contract.address`). Otherwise, the callback will error and the contract will not be
  called.
</Callout>

## Receiving IBC Callbacks

To receive callbacks, you need to implement two new entrypoints in your contract:

- `ibc_source_callback`, receiving an [`IbcSourceCallbackMsg`] enum which can be one of two types:
  - [`IbcAckCallbackMsg`] if the packet was acknowledged
  - [`IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg`] if the packet timed out
- `ibc_destination_callback`, receiving an [`IbcDestinationCallbackMsg`]

[`IbcSourceCallbackMsg`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/enum.IbcSourceCallbackMsg.html
[`IbcAckCallbackMsg`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.IbcAckCallbackMsg.html
[`IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg.html
[`IbcDestinationCallbackMsg`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.IbcDestinationCallbackMsg.html

### Source Callback

The `ibc_source_callback` entrypoint is called when the packet was either acknowledged or timed out.
You can use this to update your contract state, release locked funds or trigger other actions.

As mentioned above, the receiver of this callback is always the contract that sent the message. This
means you don't need to assume that an attacker might be sending you fake callbacks, reducing the
need for validation.

This is how you can implement the `ibc_source_callback` entrypoint:

```rust template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_source_callback(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    msg: IbcSourceCallbackMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    match msg {
        IbcSourceCallbackMsg::Acknowledgement(IbcAckCallbackMsg {
            acknowledgement,
            original_packet,
            relayer,
            ..
        }) => {
            // handle the acknowledgement
        }
        IbcSourceCallbackMsg::Timeout(IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg {
            packet, relayer, ..
        }) => {
            // handle the timeout
        }
    }

    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::new().add_attribute("action", "ibc_source_callback"))
}
```

#### Acknowledgement

When the packet was acknowledged, you will receive the `Acknowledgement(IbcAckCallbackMsg)` variant
of `IbcSourceCallbackMsg`. This means that the packet was successfully received and processed by the
application on the destination chain. The message contains the original packet data, the
acknowledgement and the address of the relayer.

#### Timeout

When the packet timed out, you will receive the `Timeout(IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg)` variant of
`IbcSourceCallbackMsg`. This means that the packet was not delivered to the destination chain in
time (e.g. because no relayer picked it up or the chain is stopped). The message contains the
original packet data and the address of the relayer who told you about the timeout.

### Destination Callback

The `ibc_destination_callback` entrypoint is called when a packet was acknowledged on the
destination chain. The shape of an acknowledgement is protocol specific and usually contains both
success and error cases.

For the `IbcMsg::Transfer` message, a success acknowledgement means that the tokens were
successfully transferred to the destination chain. It allows you to use the received tokens
immediately, update the contract state to reflect the new tokens or trigger other actions.

<Callout type="warning">
  It is important to validate that the packet and acknowledgement are what you expect them to be.
  For example for a transfer message, the receiver of the funds is not necessarily the contract that
  receives the callbacks.
</Callout>

This is how you can implement the `ibc_destination_callback` entrypoint:

<Callout>
  This example uses the `ibc` crate with the `serde` feature, which provides a data type for the
  transfer packet format to avoid defining that ourselves. You can add it to your `Cargo.toml` by
  running `cargo add ibc --features serde`.
</Callout>

```rust template="core"
use ibc::apps::transfer::types::packet::PacketData as TransferPacketData;

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_destination_callback(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    msg: IbcDestinationCallbackMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    ensure_eq!(
        msg.packet.dest.port_id,
        "transfer", // transfer module uses this port by default
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle transfer packets")
    );
    ensure_eq!(
        msg.ack.data,
        StdAck::success(b"\x01").to_binary(), // this is how a successful transfer ack looks
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle successful transfers")
    );
    // At this point we know that this is a callback for a successful transfer,
    // but not to whom it is going, how much and what denom.

    // Parse the packet data to get that information:
    let packet_data: TransferPacketData = from_json(&msg.packet.data)?;

    // The receiver should be a valid address on this chain.
    // Remember, we are on the destination chain.
    let receiver = deps.api.addr_validate(packet_data.receiver.as_ref())?;
    ensure_eq!(
        receiver,
        env.contract.address,
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle transfers to this contract")
    );

    // We only care about this chain's native token in this example.
    // The `packet_data.token.denom` is formatted as `{port id}/{channel id}/{denom}`,
    // where the port id and channel id are the source chain's identifiers.
    // Assuming we are running this on Neutron and only want to handle NTRN tokens,
    // the denom should look like this:
    let ntrn_denom = format!(
        "{}/{}/untrn",
        msg.packet.src.port_id, msg.packet.src.channel_id
    );
    ensure_eq!(
        packet_data.token.denom.to_string(),
        ntrn_denom,
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle NTRN tokens")
    );

    // Now, we can do something with our tokens.
    // For example, we could send them to some address:
    let msg = BankMsg::Send {
        to_address: "neutron155exr8rqjrknusllpzxdfvezxr8ddpqehj9g9d".to_string(),
        // this panics if the amount is too large
        amount: coins(packet_data.token.amount.as_ref().as_u128(), "untrn"),
    };

    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::new()
        .add_message(msg)
        .add_attribute("action", "ibc_destination_callback"))
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that this example assumes an ICS20 v1 channel. At the time of writing, the
  specification and implementation have just been extended with a v2 which changes the [packet
  format]. If you want to use this in production code, you should make sure to support both formats,
  such that a channel upgrade does not break your contract.
</Callout>

As mentioned above, anyone can send you a destination callback for a packet. This means you need to
make sure that the packet and acknowledgement are what you expect them to be. For example, for a
transfer message, you need to make sure that the transfer was successful, that the receiver of the
funds is your contract and the denomination is what you want to receive. This requires some
knowledge about the [packet format].

### Error handling

Returning an error or panicking from a callback will **not** influence the IBC packet lifecycle. The
packet will still be acknowledged or timed out. This means that you can safely return errors from
your callbacks if you want to ignore the packet.

It will, however, undo any state changes that you made in the callback, just like most other
entrypoints.
