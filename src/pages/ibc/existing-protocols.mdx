# Using existing protocols

The easiest way to use IBC is to use an already existing protocol. These protocols can either be
implemented by the chain itself or by another contract.

One example for the former is the `IbcMsg::Transfer` message, which causes an [ICS20] transfer. This
message is included in the CosmWasm standard library. It causes the chain's IBC transfer module to
send tokens to another chain.

An example for the latter is the [Nois protocol]. It provides a proxy contract that handles all the
IBC logic for you. We will later cover how to implement your own IBC protocol.

[ICS20]: https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer/README.md
[Nois protocol]: https://docs.nois.network/dapp_devs/use_nois_randomness.html

## Example: `IbcMsg::Transfer`

To initiate an ICS20 transfer, you need to attach an `IbcMsg::Transfer` message to your contract
response like this:

```rust template="execute"
// construct the transfer message
let msg = IbcMsg::Transfer {
    channel_id: "channel-0".to_string(),
    to_address: "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    amount: Coin::new(123u128, "ucoin"),
    timeout: env.block.time.plus_seconds(60).into(),
    memo: None,
};

// attach the message and return the response
Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

Sending this message causes an IBC transfer of the given `amount` from your contract to the
destination chain at the other end of the given channel.

The `channel_id` is the identifier of the channel you want to use for the transfer. Which channel
that should be depends on the source and destination chain. You can find out the correct channel ID
using a [block explorer](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/relayers).

The `to_address` is the address on the _destination chain_ that should receive the tokens.

The `amount` is the number and denomination of tokens to send. On the destination chain, the same
amount will be received, but the denomination will be of the form `ibc/HASH`, where `HASH` is a
SHA256 hash uniquely identifying the channel and the source chain denomination. To learn more about
this, take a look at the [Cosmos Developer Portal].

The `timeout` can either be a timestamp or a block height, as measured on the destination chain. It
is used to prevent the transfer from being stuck in limbo if the destination chain does not receive
the packet.

The `memo` is an optional field that can be used to attach a message to the transfer. It is often
used for additional functionality like [packet-forward-middleware] or IBC Callbacks.

## ADR-8: IBC Callbacks

When you send an ICS20 transfer as described above, you do not get any feedback on whether the
transfer was successful or not and the destination does not get informed of its newfound wealth. To
solve this problem, the [ADR-8 specification][adr-8] was created. On the source chain, it provides
callbacks when an IBC packet was acknowledged or timed out. On the destination chain, it triggers
callbacks when a packet is received.

IBC Callbacks is a generalized successor of [IBC Hooks][ibc-hooks].

[adr-8]: https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-008-app-caller-cbs.md
[ibc-hooks]: https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/blob/main/modules/ibc-hooks/README.md

<Callout>
  To receive callbacks, the chain needs to support IBC Callbacks for the message type.
</Callout>

### Enabling IBC Callbacks for a message

You need to explicitly opt-in to IBC Callbacks for each message. In order to do this, you need to
add some metadata to the message, including who should receive the callbacks.

<Callout>
  The exact data format and how to add it to the message can vary, but for the `IbcMsg::Transfer`
  message, this data is in JSON format and needs to be added to the `memo` field.
</Callout>

To make this as easy as possible, we provide two ways to generate the correct JSON. One is a builder
type for the `IbcMsg::Transfer` type which provides a type-safe way to generate the complete
`IbcMsg::Transfer`, the other is a helper type [`IbcCallbackRequest`] that just generates the JSON
for the `memo` field:

[`IbcCallbackRequest`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.IbcCallbackRequest.html

<Tabs items={['TransferMsgBuilder (recommended)', 'IbcCallbackRequest']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>

```rust template="execute"
let msg = TransferMsgBuilder::new(
    "channel-0".to_string(),
    "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    Coin::new(10u32, "ucoin"),
    Timestamp::from_seconds(12345),
)
.with_src_callback(IbcSrcCallback {
    address: env.contract.address,
    gas_limit: None,
})
.with_dst_callback(IbcDstCallback {
    address: "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    gas_limit: None,
})
.build();

Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>

```rust template="execute"
let msg = IbcMsg::Transfer {
    channel_id: "channel-0".to_string(),
    to_address: "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    amount: Coin::new(10u32, "ucoin"),
    timeout: Timestamp::from_seconds(12345).into(),
    memo: Some(to_json_string(&IbcCallbackRequest::both(IbcSrcCallback {
        address: env.contract.address,
        gas_limit: None,
    }, IbcDstCallback {
        address: "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
        gas_limit: None,
    })).unwrap()),
};

Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

    </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

As you can see, you can request callbacks for both the source and destination chain. However, you
can also request callbacks for only one of them. For this, you need to provide the address that
should receive the callback and you can optionally set a gas limit for the callback execution.
Please take a look at the `IbcCallbackRequest` docs for more information.

<Callout>
  The `address` of the source callback always needs to be the contract address that sends the
  message (`env.contract.address`). Otherwise, the callback will error and the contract will not be
  called.
</Callout>

### Receiving IBC Callbacks

To receive callbacks, you need to implement two new entrypoints in your contract:

- `ibc_source_callback`, receiving an [`IbcSourceCallbackMsg`] enum which can be one of two types:
  - [`IbcAckCallbackMsg`] if the packet was acknowledged
  - [`IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg`] if the packet timed out
- `ibc_destination_callback`, receiving an [`IbcDestinationCallbackMsg`]

[`IbcSourceCallbackMsg`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/enum.IbcSourceCallbackMsg.html
[`IbcAckCallbackMsg`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.IbcAckCallbackMsg.html
[`IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg.html
[`IbcDestinationCallbackMsg`]:
  https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.IbcDestinationCallbackMsg.html

#### Source Callback

The `ibc_source_callback` entrypoint is called when the packet was either acknowledged or timed out.
You can use this to update your contract state, release locked funds or trigger other actions.

As mentioned above, the receiver of this callback is always the contract that sent the message. This
means you don't need to assume that an attacker might be sending you fake callbacks, reducing the
need for validation.

This is how you can implement the `ibc_source_callback` entrypoint:

```rust template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_source_callback(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    msg: IbcSourceCallbackMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    match msg {
        IbcSourceCallbackMsg::Acknowledgement(IbcAckCallbackMsg {
            acknowledgement,
            original_packet,
            relayer,
            ..
        }) => {
            // handle the acknowledgement
        }
        IbcSourceCallbackMsg::Timeout(IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg {
            packet, relayer, ..
        }) => {
            // handle the timeout
        }
    }

    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::new().add_attribute("action", "ibc_source_callback"))
}
```

##### Acknowledgement

When the packet was acknowledged, you will receive the `Acknowledgement(IbcAckCallbackMsg)` variant
of `IbcSourceCallbackMsg`. This means that the packet was successfully received and processed by the
application on the destination chain. The message contains the original packet data, the
acknowledgement and the address of the relayer.

##### Timeout

When the packet timed out, you will receive the `Timeout(IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg)` variant of
`IbcSourceCallbackMsg`. This means that the packet was not delivered to the destination chain in
time (e.g. because no relayer picked it up or the chain is stopped). The message contains the
original packet data and the address of the relayer who told you about the timeout.

#### Destination Callback

The `ibc_destination_callback` entrypoint is called when a packet was acknowledged on the
destination chain. The shape of an acknowledgement is protocol specific and usually contains both
success and error cases.

For the `IbcMsg::Transfer` message, a success acknowledgement means that the tokens were
successfully transferred to the destination chain. It allows you to use the received tokens
immediately, update the contract state to reflect the new tokens or trigger other actions.

<Callout type="warning">
  It is important to validate that the packet and acknowledgement are what you expect them to be.
  For example for a transfer message, the receiver of the funds is not necessarily the contract that
  receives the callbacks.
</Callout>

This is how you can implement the `ibc_destination_callback` entrypoint:

<Callout>
  This example uses the `ibc` crate with the `serde` feature, which provides a data type for the
  transfer packet format to avoid defining that ourselves. You can add it to your `Cargo.toml` by
  running `cargo add ibc --features serde`.
</Callout>

```rust template="core"
use ibc::apps::transfer::types::packet::PacketData as TransferPacketData;

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_destination_callback(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    msg: IbcDestinationCallbackMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    ensure_eq!(
        msg.packet.dest.port_id,
        "transfer", // transfer module uses this port by default
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle transfer packets")
    );
    ensure_eq!(
        msg.ack.data,
        StdAck::success(b"\x01").to_binary(), // this is how a successful transfer ack looks
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle successful transfers")
    );
    // At this point we know that this is a callback for a successful transfer,
    // but not to whom it is going, how much and what denom.

    // Parse the packet data to get that information:
    let packet_data: TransferPacketData = from_json(&msg.packet.data)?;

    // The receiver should be a valid address on this chain.
    // Remember, we are on the destination chain.
    let receiver = deps.api.addr_validate(packet_data.receiver.as_ref())?;
    ensure_eq!(
        receiver,
        env.contract.address,
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle transfers to this contract")
    );

    // We only care about this chain's native token in this example.
    // The `packet_data.token.denom` is formatted as `{port id}/{channel id}/{denom}`,
    // where the port id and channel id are the source chain's identifiers.
    // Assuming we are running this on Neutron and only want to handle NTRN tokens,
    // the denom should look like this:
    let ntrn_denom = format!(
        "{}/{}/untrn",
        msg.packet.src.port_id, msg.packet.src.channel_id
    );
    ensure_eq!(
        packet_data.token.denom.to_string(),
        ntrn_denom,
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle NTRN tokens")
    );

    // Now, we can do something with our tokens.
    // For example, we could send them to some address:
    let msg = BankMsg::Send {
        to_address: "neutron155exr8rqjrknusllpzxdfvezxr8ddpqehj9g9d".to_string(),
        // this panics if the amount is too large
        amount: coins(packet_data.token.amount.as_ref().as_u128(), "untrn"),
    };

    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::new()
        .add_message(msg)
        .add_attribute("action", "ibc_destination_callback"))
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that this example assumes an ICS20 v1 channel. At the time of writing, the
  specification and implementation have just been extended with a v2 which changes the [packet
  format]. If you want to use this in production code, you should make sure to support both formats,
  such that a channel upgrade does not break your contract.
</Callout>

As mentioned above, anyone can send you a destination callback for a packet. This means you need to
make sure that the packet and acknowledgement are what you expect them to be. For example, for a
transfer message, you need to make sure that the transfer was successful, that the receiver of the
funds is your contract and the denomination is what you want to receive. This requires some
knowledge about the [packet format].

#### Error handling

Returning an error or panicking from a callback will **not** influence the IBC packet lifecycle. The
packet will still be acknowledged or timed out. This means that you can safely return errors from
your callbacks if you want to ignore the packet.

It will, however, undo any state changes that you made in the callback, just like most other
entrypoints.
