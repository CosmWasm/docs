# Using existing protocols

The easiest way to use IBC is to use an already existing protocol. These
protocols can either be implemented by the chain itself or by another contract.

One example for the former is the `IbcMsg::Transfer` message, which causes an
[ICS20] transfer. This message is included in the CosmWasm standard library. It
causes the chain's IBC transfer module to send tokens to another chain.

An example for the latter is the [Nois protocol]. It provides a proxy contract that
handles all the IBC logic for you. We will later cover how to implement your own
IBC protocol.

[ICS20]:
  https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer/README.md
[Nois protocol]: https://docs.nois.network/dapp_devs/use_nois_randomness.html

## Example: `IbcMsg::Transfer`

To initiate an ICS20 transfer, you need to attach an `IbcMsg::Transfer` message
to your contract response like this:

```rust template="execute"
// construct the transfer message
let msg = IbcMsg::Transfer {
    channel_id: "channel-0".to_string(),
    to_address: "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    amount: Coin::new(123u128, "ucoin"),
    timeout: env.block.time.plus_seconds(60).into(),
    memo: None,
};

// attach the message and return the response
Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

Sending this message causes an IBC transfer of the given `amount` from your
contract to the destination chain at the other end of the given channel.

The `channel_id` is the identifier of the channel you want to use for the
transfer. Which channel that should be depends on the source and destination
chain. You can find out the correct channel ID using a
[block explorer](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/relayers).

The `to_address` is the address on the _destination chain_ that should receive
the tokens.

The `amount` is the number and denomination of tokens to send. On the
destination chain, the same amount will be received, but the denomination will
be of the form `ibc/HASH`, where `HASH` is a SHA256 hash uniquely identifying
the channel and the source chain denomination. To learn more about this, take a
look at the [Cosmos Developer Portal].

The `timeout` can either be a timestamp or a block height, as measured on the
destination chain. It is used to prevent the transfer from being stuck in limbo
if the destination chain does not receive the packet.

The `memo` is an optional field that can be used to attach a message to the
transfer. It is often used for additional functionality like
[packet-forward-middleware] or IBC Callbacks.

## ADR-8: IBC Callbacks

When you send an ICS20 transfer as described above, you do not get any feedback
on whether the transfer was successful or not and the destination does not get
informed of its newfound wealth. To solve this problem, the [ADR-8
specification][adr-8] was created. On the source chain, it provides callbacks
when an IBC packet was acknowledged or timed out. On the destination chain, it
triggers callbacks when a packet is received.

IBC Callbacks is a generalized successor of [IBC Hooks][ibc-hooks].

[adr-8]:

[ibc-hooks]:
  https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/blob/main/modules/ibc-hooks/README.md

<Callout>
  To receive callbacks, the chain needs to support IBC Callbacks for the message
  type.
</Callout>

### Enabling IBC Callbacks for a message

You need to explicitly opt-in to IBC Callbacks for each message. In order to do
this, you need to add some metadata to the message, including who should receive
the callbacks.

<Callout>
  The exact data format and how to add it to the message can vary, but for the
  `IbcMsg::Transfer` message, this data is in JSON format and needs to be added
  to the `memo` field.
</Callout>

{/* TODO: add link to `IbcCallbackRequest` docs once IBC Callbacks are released */}

To make this as easy as possible, we provide two ways to generate the correct
JSON. One is a builder type for the `IbcMsg::Transfer` type which provides a
type-safe way to generate the complete `IbcMsg::Transfer`, the other is a helper
type `IbcCallbackRequest` that just generates the JSON for the `memo` field:

{/* TODO: add `template="execute"` once IBC Callbacks are released */}

<Tabs items={['TransferMsgBuilder (recommended)', 'IbcCallbackRequest']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>

```rust
let msg = TransferMsgBuilder::new(
    "channel-0".to_string(),
    "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    Coin::new(10u32, "ucoin"),
    Timestamp::from_seconds(12345),
)
.with_src_callback(IbcSrcCallback {
    address: env.contract.address,
    gas_limit: None,
})
.with_dst_callback(IbcDstCallback {
    address: to_address.clone(),
    gas_limit: None,
})
.build();

Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>

```rust
let msg = IbcMsg::Transfer {
    channel_id: "channel-0".to_string(),
    to_address: "cosmos1exampleaddress".to_string(),
    amount: Coin::new(10u32, "ucoin"),
    timeout: Timestamp::from_seconds(12345).into(),
    memo: Some(to_json_string(&IbcCallbackRequest::both(IbcSrcCallback {
        address: env.contract.address,
        gas_limit: None,
    }, IbcDstCallback {
        address: to_address.clone(),
        gas_limit: None,
    })).unwrap()),
};

Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
```

    </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

As you can see, you can request callbacks for both the source and destination
chain. However, you can also request callbacks for only one of them. For this,
you need to provide the address that should receive the callback and you can
optionally set a gas limit for the callback execution. Please take a look at the
`IbcCallbackRequest` docs for more information.

<Callout>
  The `address` of the source callback always needs to be the contract address
  that sends the message (`env.contract.address`). Otherwise, the callback will
  error and the contract will not be called.
</Callout>

### Receiving IBC Callbacks

To receive callbacks, you need to implement two new entrypoints in your
contract:

{/* TODO: add docs links once IBC Callbacks are released */}

- `ibc_source_callback`, receiving an `IbcSourceCallbackMsg` enum which can be
  one of two types:
  - `IbcAckCallbackMsg` if the packet was acknowledged
  - `IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg` if the packet timed out
- `ibc_destination_callback`, receiving an `IbcDestinationCallbackMsg`

#### Source Callback

The `ibc_source_callback` entrypoint is called when the packet was either
acknowledged or timed out. You can use this to update your contract state,
release locked funds or trigger other actions.

As mentioned above, the receiver of this callback is always the contract that
sent the message. This means you don't need to assume that an attacker might be
sending you fake callbacks, reducing the need for validation.

This is how you can implement the `ibc_source_callback` entrypoint:

{/* TODO: Add template="core" when callbacks are released */}

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_source_callback(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    msg: IbcSourceCallbackMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    match msg {
        IbcSourceCallbackMsg::Acknowledgement(IbcAckCallbackMsg {
            acknowledgement,
            original_packet,
            relayer,
        }) => {
            // handle the acknowledgement
        }
        IbcSourceCallbackMsg::Timeout(IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg { packet, relayer }) => {
            // handle the timeout
        }
    }

    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::new().add_attribute("action", "ibc_source_callback"))
}
```

##### Acknowledgement

When the packet was acknowledged, you will receive the
`Acknowledgement(IbcAckCallbackMsg)` variant of `IbcSourceCallbackMsg`. This
means that the packet was successfully received and processed by the application
on the destination chain. The message contains the original packet data, the
acknowledgement and the address of the relayer.

##### Timeout

When the packet timed out, you will receive the `Timeout(IbcTimeoutCallbackMsg)`
variant of `IbcSourceCallbackMsg`. This means that the packet was not delivered
to the destination chain in time (e.g. because no relayer picked it up or the
chain is stopped). The message contains the original packet data and the address
of the relayer who told you about the timeout.

#### Destination Callback

The `ibc_destination_callback` entrypoint is called when a packet was
acknowledged on the destination chain. The shape of an acknowledgement is
protocol specific and usually contains both success and error cases.

For the `IbcMsg::Transfer` message, a success acknowledgement means that the
tokens were successfully transferred to the destination chain. It allows you to
use the received tokens immediately, update the contract state to reflect the
new tokens or trigger other actions.

<Callout type="warning">
  It is important to validate that the packet and acknowledgement are what you
  expect them to be. For example for a transfer message, the receiver of the
  funds is not necessarily the contract that receives the callbacks.
</Callout>

This is how you can implement the `ibc_destination_callback` entrypoint:

<Callout>
  This example uses the `ibc` crate with the `serde` feature, which provides a
  data type for the transfer packet format to avoid defining that ourselves. You
  can add it to your `Cargo.toml` by running `cargo add ibc --features serde`.
</Callout>

{/* TODO: Add template="core" when callbacks are released */}

```rust
use ibc::apps::transfer::types::packet::PacketData as TransferPacketData;

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn ibc_destination_callback(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    msg: IbcDestinationCallbackMsg,
) -> StdResult<IbcBasicResponse> {
    ensure_eq!(
        msg.packet.dest.port_id,
        "transfer", // transfer module uses this port by default
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle transfer packets")
    );
    ensure_eq!(
        msg.ack.data,
        StdAck::success(b"\x01").to_binary(), // this is how a successful transfer ack looks
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle successful transfers")
    );
    // At this point we know that this is a callback for a successful transfer,
    // but not to whom it is going, how much and what denom.

    // Parse the packet data to get that information:
    let packet_data: TransferPacketData = from_json(&msg.packet.data)?;

    // The receiver should be a valid address on this chain.
    // Remember, we are on the destination chain.
    let receiver = deps.api.addr_validate(packet_data.receiver.as_ref())?;
    ensure_eq!(
        receiver,
        env.contract.address,
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle transfers to this contract")
    );

    // We only care about this chain's native token in this example.
    // The `packet_data.token.denom` is formatted as `{port id}/{channel id}/{denom}`,
    // where the port id and channel id are the source chain's identifiers.
    // Assuming we are running this on Neutron and only want to handle NTRN tokens,
    // the denom should look like this:
    let ntrn_denom = format!(
        "{}/{}/untrn",
        msg.packet.src.port_id, msg.packet.src.channel_id
    );
    ensure_eq!(
        packet_data.token.denom.to_string(),
        ntrn_denom,
        StdError::generic_err("only want to handle NTRN tokens")
    );

    // Now, we can do something with our tokens.
    // For example, we could send them to some address:
    let msg = BankMsg::Send {
        to_address: "neutron155exr8rqjrknusllpzxdfvezxr8ddpqehj9g9d".to_string(),
        // this panics if the amount is too large
        amount: coins(packet_data.token.amount.as_ref().as_u128(), "untrn"),
    };

    Ok(IbcBasicResponse::new()
        .add_message(msg)
        .add_attribute("action", "ibc_destination_callback"))
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that this example assumes an ICS20 v1 channel. At the time of
  writing, the specification and implementation have just been extended with a
  v2 which changes the [packet format]. If you want to use this in production
  code, you should make sure to support both formats, such that a channel
  upgrade does not break your contract.
</Callout>

As mentioned above, anyone can send you a destination callback for a packet.
This means you need to make sure that the packet and acknowledgement are what
you expect them to be. For example, for a transfer message, you need to make
sure that the transfer was successful, that the receiver of the funds is your
contract and the denomination is what you want to receive. This requires some
knowledge about the [packet format].

#### Error handling

Returning an error or panicking from a callback will **not** influence the IBC
packet lifecycle. The packet will still be acknowledged or timed out. This means
that you can safely return errors from your callbacks if you want to ignore the
packet.

It will, however, undo any state changes that you made in the callback, just
like most other entrypoints.
