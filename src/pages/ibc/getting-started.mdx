# Getting started

To get started, you need to enable the `stargate` feature of the `cosmwasm-std` crate. This will
enable additional functionality that is not available on all chains, including IBC support.

```toml
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2", features = ["stargate"] }
```

<Callout type="info">
  The naming "stargate" is somewhat confusing. It is a reference to the Cosmos SDK 0.40 upgrade with
  the same name. This upgrade introduced (among other things) IBC.
</Callout>
