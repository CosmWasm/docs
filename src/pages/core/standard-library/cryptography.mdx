# Cryptography

CosmWasm offers cryptographic primitives that are implemented as VM intrinsics.
This means that they are more efficient than implementations in contract code
could be, saving you gas and code size. In some cases they are also _impossible_
to implement in contract code, since some of them require a random intermediate
value and randomness is generally not exposed to contracts to ensure
deterministic execution.

In the sidebar, you can find all the supported algorithms/curves along with
documentation about them.

If you are looking for a list of gas costs for these operations, you can find
them in the
[source code](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/packages/vm/src/environment.rs#L62-L101).

## Note on hash functions

You'll notice that CosmWasm does not implement any hash functions as native
functions, and we intend to keep it that way. The reasoning for that is:

- Hash functions are pretty much always cheap in terms of execution cost _and_
  code size
- There are way too many hash functions out there, adding one would open the
  floodgates where we would have to add more
  - SHA-3 family, Keccak256, cSHAKE256, BLAKE2, BLAKE3, SHA-2 family,
    KangarooTwelve, etc. (and this is just a small sample set to drive the point
    home)
- Benchmarking and pricing functions (and keeping those up-to-date) correctly is
  a lot of work
- We want to keep the API surface as small as possible for ease of maintainance

Keep in mind that, thanks to Wasm being our execution environment, contract
execution is quite fast. In most cases the perceived need to move hashing into a
host function is premature optimization and not actually needed.
