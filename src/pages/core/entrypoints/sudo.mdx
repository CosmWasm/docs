# Sudo

`sudo` is a special endpoint that you will probably rarely use in practice.

This is where you will receive messages issued _by the chain itself_ and it
won't be invoked by clients or other contracts.

And since these are special messages you will only receive from the chain, the
messages you will receive are not defined by yourself, and instead usually
provided by some sort of chain SDK.

## Definition

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
#[entry_point]
pub fn sudo(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: SudoMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```
