# Installation

## Setting up the environment

Before diving right into writing code, you need to install some tooling in order
to compile your contract. CosmWasm is luckily rather self-contained and
therefore needs little external tooling to compile.  
Our only external dependency is Rust, which you need to install for your
platform.

<Callout>
  We recommend installing Rust using the official [rustup installer]. This makes
  it easy to stay on the most recent Rust version and to install compiler
  targets.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  For production builds you probably also want to install [Docker], too.
  <br /> This is because we offer the [CosmWasm Optimizing Compiler], which uses
  a Docker image to build the smallest contract possible in a deterministic fashion.

  <details>

    <summary>Additional information about the Optimizing Compiler</summary>

    Please note that this image is intended for reproducible production builds.
    It is _not_ optimized for development or in general environments where you
    want to iterate quickly. The builder is optimizing for size, not compilation speed.
    If you want to slim down your contract for development, you can do so by
    tweaking your Cargo profile.

    ```toml
    [profile.dev]
    lto = "thin"
    strip = true
    ```

    If you want to build with native tools, you might miss out on determinism, but you can still build your contract into a small size like so:

    ```sh
    RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-s" cargo build --release --lib --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown
    wasm-opt -Os --signext-lowering "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my-contract.wasm" -o "artifacts/my-contract.wasm"
    ```

    (Note: Replace `my-contract` with the name of your contract. You also need `wasm-opt` installed, which is part of the [binaryen] project.)

  </details>

</Callout>

After installing Rust, you need to add the WebAssembly target. This is needed so
Rust knows how to build your code to WebAssembly.

To install the target using `rustup`, run the following command:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Perfect!  
Now that we set up the foundation we just need two more tools:

1. `cargo-generate`
2. `cargo-run-script` (this is required to later optimize your contract for
   production)

To install those, run the following commands:

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

## Setting up the contract

Now that the environment is all done, let's create the project!

Luckily you don't need to start from scratch, we already took care of the most
tedious parts of setting up a new project in form of a template!

In order to generate a fresh project, run this command and off we go:

<Callout>
  Make sure to change `PROJECT_NAME` to the name of your contract!
</Callout>

```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template.git --name PROJECT_NAME
```

Now you should have a ready contract project in a new folder called
`PROJECT_NAME` (or whatever you changed it to).
