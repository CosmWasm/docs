# Ed25519

CosmWasm offers an API to verify and batch verify Ed25519 signatures. This is powerful, especially
since batch verifications require a random component which is impossible to implement in contract
code.

Ed25519 is known to [have issues with inconsistent validation criteria], the API we offer follows
[ZIP215]. This means you will have no issues with signatures being valid in one place and invalid in
another.

## Example

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(
    deps: Deps,
    _env: Env,
    msg: Ed25519VerifyMsg,
) -> StdResult<QueryResponse> {
    let public_key = msg.public_key;
    let signature = msg.signature;
    let message = msg.message;

    // Verify the signature. On chain!
    let is_valid = deps.api.ed25519_verify(&message, &signature, &public_key)?;
    let response = to_json_binary(&VerifyResponse {
        is_valid
    })?;

    Ok(response)
}
```
