# Introduction

This chapter will give you an overview over CosmWasm from a contract developer
perspective, its capabilities, and guide you through initializing your first
smart contract.

<Callout>
  We assume you have basic knowledge of Rust and Cargo (its standard build
  system)
</Callout>

## What is CosmWasm?

CosmWasm is a platform for writing smart contracts for Cosmos chains using Rust
and WebAssembly.  
Meaning CosmWasm is your one-stop shop for developing, testing, and running
smart contracts on enabled chains.

## What does CosmWasm provide?

For you, a contract developer, CosmWasm provides a set of high-quality
primitives through our standard library. These primitives include:

- extended precision arithmetic (128, 256, 512-bit integers)
- cryptographic primitives (for example, secp256k1 verification)
- interaction with the Cosmos SDK

## What does CosmWasm _not_ provide?

- Abstractions to simplify contract development (for this, check out
  [Sylvia](/sylvia))
- Storage abstractions (for this, check out [Storey](/storey))
