# Features

All **`MultiTest`** features a listed in the following table. The **"Default implementation"**
column indicates whether the feature has a default implementation in **`MultiTest`** that simulates
the functionality of the real blockchain as closely as possible. In cases where **`MultiTest`** does
not have a default implementation for the feature, users may provide their own, using `AppBuilder`'s
function listed in **"AppBuilder constructor"** column. Names of **`MultiTest`** feature flags
required to enable specific functionality are provided in the column **"Feature flag"**.

## Starting point

Usually, a good starting point when using **`MultiTest`** is the following dependency configuration
in `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
cosmwasm-std = "2"

[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = { version = "2", features = ["staking", "stargate", "cosmwasm_2_0"] }
```
