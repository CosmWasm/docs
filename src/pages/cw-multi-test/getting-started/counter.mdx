# Counter

The following sections describe how to create an example smart contract, which manages a **counter**
that can be `initialized`, `incremented`, `decremented`, and `queried`. Later on, you will be
[writing tests](writing-tests.mdx) for this smart contract using **`MultiTest`**.

<Callout type="info" emoji="â˜‰">
  **Counter** smart contract is a simplified version of the contract created from the
  [cw&#8209;template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template). Check [Setting up the
  contract](/core/installation#setting-up-the-contract) for more details.
</Callout>

## Specification

The example smart contract is a simple **counter** that allows users to initialize the counter,
perform operations such as incrementing, decrementing, setting a specific value, and querying the
current counter value. The primary purpose of this contract is to maintain and manipulate a counter
value on the blockchain. This functionality can be utilized in various scenarios where a count or
tally needs to be tracked, such as counting votes, tracking the number of actions performed, or
maintaining a score in a game or competition.

**Features:**

- The counter can be initialized with a value of zero or any non-negative integer between 0 and 255.
- Users can increment, decrement, or set the counter to a new value within the range of 0 to 255.
- Boundary conditions are checked, preventing the counter from going below 0 or beyond 255.
- Users can query the current value of the counter at any time.
- The counter's value is persisted and limited to 8-bit unsigned integers [0..255].

## Creating the counter project

Smart contracts written in Rust are developed as Rust libraries, so let's first create a Rust
library named **counter**.

Change the working directory to your home directory:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cd ~
```

Create a dedicated directory to store your example smart contract:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
mkdir my-contracts
```

Change the working directory to `my-contracts`:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cd my-contracts
```

Create a new Rust library named **counter**:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo init --lib counter
```

Change the working directory to `counter`:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cd counter
```

Newly created library contains the **Cargo.toml** file and **lib.rs** file in `src` directory...

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
tree
```

...so the expected structure of the `counter` directory is:

```ansi filename="counter (directory)"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€Â Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€Â [34;1msrc[0m
Â Â Â Â â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
```

By convention, the source code of the smart contract is placed in a file named **contract.rs**, and
the messages processed by this contract are usually placed in file named **msg.rs**. Both files
should be stored in `src` directory.

Let's create an empty **contract.rs** file...

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
touch src/contract.rs
```

...and empty **msg.rs** file:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
touch src/msg.rs
```

The final structure of the smart contract project placed in the `counter` directory should look like
this:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
tree
```

```ansi filename="counter (directory)"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€Â Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€Â [34;1msrc[0m
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€â”€ contract.rs
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
Â Â Â Â â””â”€â”€ msg.rs
```

## Filling the content

In the previous section you have created a project structure for **counter** smart contract, but the
source files are still empty. In the following chapters, we provide examples of two different
implementations of the **counter** smart contract. The first one is using the pure CosmWasm
libraries, and the second one is using the Sylvia framework.

Whether you're interested in developing smart contracts using pure CosmWasm libraries or exploring
the Sylvia framework, the following examples will guide you through the basic content of the smart
contract.

<Callout>
  To better understand how the Sylvia framework can streamline and simplify smart contract
  development, we recommend creating and testing the counter smart contract in both ways.
