# `AppBuilder`

[`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder] is an implementation of the [Builder Pattern] that provides a
flexible and modular way to construct the [`App{:rust}`](app) blockchain simulator. It allows smart
contract developers to configure various components of the blockchain simulator (e.g., Bank,
Staking, Gov, IBC) individually through dedicated `with_*` methods. Each method modifies and returns
a new instance of the builder, enabling method chaining for a fluent interface. The
[`build{:rust}`][build] method finalizes the construction process, ensuring that all components are
correctly initialized and integrated.

The following sections detail all builder functions, providing specific usage examples.

## `default`

The simplest way to create a chain using [`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder] is by calling the
`default{:rust}` method. Since [`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder] follows the principles of the
builder pattern, you need to finalize the building process by calling the [`build{:rust}`][build]
method with a chain initialization callback function. When no specific chain initialization is
required you can just use provided [`no_init`](app#no_init) callback. In the following code example,
the chain is created with default settings as described in
[Features summary](features#features-summary).

```rust showLineNumbers {3} copy /default/ /build/
use cw_multi_test::{no_init, AppBuilder};

let app = AppBuilder::default().build(no_init);

let sender_addr = app.api().addr_make("sender");

assert!(sender_addr.as_str().starts_with("cosmwasm1"));
```

## `new`

The constructor `new{:rust}` is an equivalent of the `default{:rust}` method in
[`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder]. The example below creates a chain with default settings as
described in [Features summary](features#features-summary).

```rust showLineNumbers {3} copy /new/ /build/
use cw_multi_test::{no_init, AppBuilder};

let app = AppBuilder::new().build(no_init);

let sender_addr = app.api().addr_make("sender");

assert!(sender_addr.as_str().starts_with("cosmwasm1"));
```

## `new_custom`

(WIP)

## `with_api`

(WIP)

## `with_bank`

(WIP)

## `with_block`

While the default block configuration is sufficient for most test cases, you can initialize the
chain with a custom [`BlockInfo{:rust}`][BlockInfo] using the [`with_block{:rust}`][with_block]
method provided by [`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder].

The following example demonstrates this use case in detail.

```rust showLineNumbers copy {15} /with_block/
use cosmwasm_std::{BlockInfo, Timestamp};
use cw_multi_test::{no_init, AppBuilder};

// create the chain builder
let builder = AppBuilder::default();

// prepare the custom block
let block = BlockInfo {
    height: 1,
    time: Timestamp::from_seconds(1723627489),
    chain_id: "starship-testnet".to_string(),
};

// build the chain initialized with the custom block
let app = builder.with_block(block).build(no_init);

// get the current block properties
let block = app.block_info();

// now the block height is 21
assert_eq!(1, block.height);

// now the block timestamp is Wed Aug 14 2024 09:24:49 GMT+0000
assert_eq!(1723627489, block.time.seconds());

// now the chain identifier is "starship-testnet"
assert_eq!("starship-testnet", block.chain_id);
```

The [`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder] is initialized with default settings in line 5. A custom block
is created in lines 8-12 and passed to the [`with_block{:rust}`][with_block] method in line 15.
Since this is the only customization in this example, the blockchain construction is finalized in
the same line by calling the [`build{:rust}`][build] method.

The current block metadata is retrieved in line 18, followed by value checks:

- line 21: the block height is now `1{:rust}`,
- line 24: the block time is set to the Unix timestamp `1723627489{:rust}`, representing
  `Wednesday, August 14, 2024, 09:24:49 GMT`,
- line 27: the chain identifier is now `"starship-testnet"{:rust}`.

The [`with_block{:rust}`][with_block] method of [`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder] can be combined
with any other `with_*` methods to configure a custom starting block.

## `with_custom`

(WIP)

## `with_distribution`

(WIP)

## `with_gov`

The [`with_gov{:rust}`][with_gov] function allows you to customize the governance module of your
test blockchain environment. This function enables you to override the default governance module
with a custom implementation that suits your specific testing needs. Currently, **`MultiTest`**
provides two minimal implementations of the governance module that do not attempt to replicate real
blockchain behavior: [`GovAcceptingModule{:rust}`][GovAcceptingModule] and
[`GovFailingModule{:rust}`][GovFailingModule].

To use a built-in governance module that accepts all messages, initialize the chain like shown below
(line 4):

```rust showLineNumbers copy {15} /with_gov/ /GovAcceptingModule/
use cw_multi_test::{no_init, AppBuilder, GovAcceptingModule};

let app = AppBuilder::default()
    .with_gov(GovAcceptingModule::new())
    .build(no_init);
```

When processing governance messages in your tests should always fail, initialize the chain like in
the following code snippet (line 4):

```rust showLineNumbers copy /with_gov/ /GovFailingModule/
use cw_multi_test::{no_init, AppBuilder, GovFailingModule};

let app = AppBuilder::default()
    .with_gov(GovFailingModule::new())
    .build(no_init);
```

<Callout>
  Note that [`GovFailingModule{:rust}`][GovFailingModule] is the default one in `App{:rust}`.
</Callout>

You can find more usage examples of the built-in governance modules in the
[Governance](./governance) chapter.

## `with_wasm`

(WIP)

## `build`

Since [`AppBuilder{:rust}`][AppBuilder] follows the principles of the builder pattern, you must
always finalize the chain-building process by calling the [`build{:rust}`][build] method with an
initialization callback function. If no specific chain initialization is required, you can use the
provided [`no_init`](app#no_init) callback. Otherwise, you can initialize the chain using a custom
callback function. An example of how to initialize a user's balance is shown below.

```rust showLineNumbers copy /build/
use cosmwasm_std::coin;
use cw_multi_test::AppBuilder;

let my_address = "me".into_addr();
let my_funds = vec![coin(23, "ATOM"), coin(18, "FLOCK")];

let app = AppBuilder::default().build(|router, api, storage| {
    router
        .bank
        .init_balance(storage, &my_address, my_funds)
        .unwrap();
});

assert_eq!(
    "23ATOM",
    app.wrap()
        .query_balance(my_address, "ATOM")
        .unwrap()
        .to_string()
);
```
