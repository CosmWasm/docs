# Black-box testing

<Callout emoji="🥁" type="warning">
  Elaborate more about this idea. Generally, a smart contract, percieved as a
  black-box with state, could be tested by just calling the entry-points with
  state changes checks. All tests should either call the entry-points or check
  the state. This way, after running all tests, we should get 100% code coverage
  on the smart contract.

  Thesis: **"Code not covered by such tests can be removed."**
