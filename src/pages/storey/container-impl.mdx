# Implementing new containers

Storey provides a set of built-in containers, but you're not limited to just those. For special
needs, you can go ahead and create your own containers that will play along nicely with the rest of
the Storey "ecosystem". If it's appropriate, your container could for example allow for nesting
other containers - like [`Map`].

In this section, you will find examples of custom containers with their full code.
