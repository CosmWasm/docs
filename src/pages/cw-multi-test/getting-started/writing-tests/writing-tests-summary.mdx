# Summary

To summarize the process of writing tests with **`MultiTest`**, leveraging both pure CosmWasm
libraries and the Sylvia framework, let’s review the general structure of a test. High-quality tests
typically follow a series of common steps to ensure thorough validation and reliability.

By adhering to these structured steps, you can create maintainable and robust test suites that
effectively validate your CosmWasm contracts:

<Steps>
  ### Initialize the chain

🖝 Set up the blockchain simulator for testing.

### Store contract(s) on chain

🖝 Upload the contract(s) code to the chain.

### Instantiate contract(s)

🖝 Instantiate contract(s) with the desired initial state.

### Interact with contract(s)

🖝 Perform actions such as queries and executes on instantiated contract(s).

### Assert expected results

🖝 Verify the outcomes against expected values to confirm correct behavior.

</Steps>

<Callout>
  While the detailed implementation of each step may vary depending on whether you are using pure
  CosmWasm libraries or the Sylvia framework — and will also differ based on the specifics of the
  test — the overall structure remains consistent, as outlined above.
