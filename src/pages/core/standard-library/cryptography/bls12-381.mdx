# BLS12-381

BLS12-381 is a bit of a special curve. It is a pairing-friendly curve, allowing
for fun things such as aggregated signatures. At the moment, CosmWasm only
supports signature verifications. In the future we might add support for
zero-knowledge proofs on this curve.

Common examples where this curve is used are Ethereum block-headers and [drand](https://drand.love/)
randomness beacons.

## Example

CosmWasm offers a byte-oriented API for signature verification. This API also
doesn't care whether the public key is part of the G1 or G2 group (same for the
other components). They just have to somehow fit together.

<Callout>TODO: Add example as soon as BLS12-381 is properly released</Callout>
