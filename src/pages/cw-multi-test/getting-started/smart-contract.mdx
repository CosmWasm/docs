# Smart contract

The following sections describe how to create the example smart contract, which manages a counter
that can be initialized, incremented, decremented, and queried. Later on, you will
[write tests](writing-tests.mdx) for this contract using **`MultiTest`**.

<Callout type="info">
  This example smart contract is a simplified version of the contract created using
  [cw-template](/core/installation#setting-up-the-contract).
</Callout>

## Creating the project

Smart contracts written in Rust are typically developed as Rust libraries, so let's first create a
Rust library named **counter**.

Change the working directory to your home directory:

```shell copy
cd ~
```

Create a dedicated directory to store your example smart contract:

```shell copy
mkdir my-contracts
```

Change the working directory to `my-contracts`:

```shell copy
cd my-contracts
```

Create a new Rust library named **counter**:

```shell copy
cargo init --lib counter
```

Change the working directory to `counter`:

```shell copy
cd counter
```

Newly created library contains the **Cargo.toml** file and **lib.rs** file in `src` directory...

```shell copy
tree
```

...so expected content of the `counter` directory is:

```ansi filename="counter"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€Â Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€Â [34;1msrc[0m
Â Â Â Â â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
```

By convention, the source code of the smart contract is placed in file named **contract.rs**, and
the messages processed by this contract are placed in file named **msg.rs**, both in `src`
directory.

Let's create the **contract.rs** file...

```shell copy
touch src/contract.rs
```

...and **msg.rs** file:

```shell copy
touch src/msg.rs
```

The final structure of the smart contract project placed in `counter` directory should look like
shown below:

```shell copy
tree
```

```ansi filename="counter"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€Â Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€Â [34;1msrc[0m
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€â”€ contract.rs
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
Â Â Â Â â””â”€â”€ msg.rs
```
