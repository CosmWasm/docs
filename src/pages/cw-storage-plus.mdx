# Introduction

Not being able to persist data across calls would limit the utility of smart
contracts. Think of these problems:

- How could a smart contract implement a token if it could not keep track of
  balances?
- How could a smart contract implement a voting system if it could not keep
  track of votes?
- How could a smart contract implement a game if it could not keep track of
  scores?

This is why a _CosmWasm_ smart contract has access to the storage facilities
offered by the [_Cosmos SDK_](https://docs.cosmos.network/). These facilities
are essentially a binary key-value store, with records stored on-chain.

## Storage limits

While developing smart contracts, it's important to remember on-chain storage
is, as always, pricey. Conventionally, developers often draw the line at a
"small logo image" (think a few KBs). If you need to store bigger things, it's
likely time to consider off-chain storage (like IPFS or some centralized
storage). Techniques for securely and reliably storing large data off-chain are
beyond the scope of this document.

Trying to minimize bloat is always good practice when it comes to on-chain
storage.

## What _cw-storage-plus_ builds on

The smart contract framework itself (`cosmwasm-std`) provides a simple API for
storing and retrieving data. If you're curious, you can check it out right
[here](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/2.0.3/cosmwasm_std/trait.Storage.html).

This API is raw in that it exposes the **binary** key-value store. While you're
free to use it directly, you're likely to find that finicky and error-prone.
`cw-storage-plus` is a library that builds on top of this API to do the
following:

- eliminate the need to manually serialize and deserialize data
- provide a type-safe interface for storing and retrieving data
- help manage keys
- provide featureful persistent data structures

Let's explore!
