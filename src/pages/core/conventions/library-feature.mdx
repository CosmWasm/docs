# Library feature

In the ecosystem, there is the convention to gate the entrypoints of your
contract behind a compile-time feature. The feature is conventionally called
`library`.

So instead of doing this:

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    _msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    Ok(Response::new())
}
```

You should do this:

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    _msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    Ok(Response::new())
}
```

<Callout>
  You can see this in action in the [`cw-plus` contracts]. Here is an example in
  the [`cw4-stake` contract].
</Callout>

The rationale behind this is that currently using `#[entry_point]` exports
special symbols from the binary, and these symbols **must** be unique.

That means if you have two `instantiate` endpoints annotated with
`#[entry_point]` _somewhere_ in your project (that includes all your
dependencies!), your contract will fail to compile.

Using this library feature will enable developers to use your contract as a
dependency and reuse your code.
