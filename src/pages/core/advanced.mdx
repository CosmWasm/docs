# Advanced topics

In this part of the documentation, we go over some more "advanced" things you can do with the
functionality CosmWasm core offers.

<Callout>
  While the name of this section is "advanced", this doesn't mean that we want to imply that you
  only need these functions in advanced contexts. The wording "advanced" moreso refers to the fact
  that you should be familiar with endpoints, the structs that are passed to the endpoints, etc.
