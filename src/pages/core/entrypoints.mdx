# Entrypoints

Entrypoints are where your contract can be called from the outside world. You can equate that to
your `main` function in C, Rust, Java, etc. However, there is one _small_ difference: In CosmWasm,
you have multiple of these entrypoints, each one different from the last.

In this section we want to give you a quick overview of all the entrypoints and when they are
called.

<Callout>
  In our examples, we will always refer to `StdResult` as the return type (and therefore `StdError` as the error type).
  This is just for convenience since every type that implements the `ToString` type can be used as an error type!

Meaning, as long as it implements `ToString`, nothing is stopping you from defining
`Result<Response, MyError>`. This can reduce your code complexity, especially if you want to use the
try operator.

</Callout>

## Defining entrypoints

While you will learn all about entrypoints in the next sections, we want to give you an idea on how
to define an entrypoint in the first place.

CosmWasm defines the handy `#[entry_point]` attribute macro. You simply annotate a function with it,
and it automatically generates code that communicates to the VM: "Hey! This is an entrypoint, please
use it when needed!"

<Callout>
  When defining an entrypoint, it is important to use the correct types for the parameters and
  return type. Incorrect types will cause errors when trying to call the contract.
  <br /> In the following sections we will take a look at all possible entrypoints, including the
  correct function signature.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  Even though the sections will show you to use `#[entry_point]`, it is recommended to define your
  endpoints as `#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]`.
  <br /> The reason behind that is that it allows you to reuse your contract as a library.
</Callout>

```rust template="core"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // Do some logic here
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

## Entrypoint parameters

Entrypoints have a few parameters (as you can see above), some of them are predefined by
`cosmwasm-std`, others are defined by the user themselves.

Here we go over the different predefined types the standard library provides, and how you can define
your own types.

### Predefined types

#### `Deps`/`DepsMut`

These structs provide you access to the:

- Storage
- VM API
- Querier

The big difference is that `DepsMut` gives you _mutable_ access to the storage. This design is
deliberate since you, for example, can't mutate the state in the `query` endpoint. Instead of
relying on runtime errors, this is made _irrepresentable_ through Rust's type system.

#### `Env`

This struct provides you with some information of the current state of the environment your contract
is executed in.

The information provided is, for example, the block height, chain ID, transaction info, etc.
Basically anything you'd ever want to know about the current state of the execution environment!

#### `MessageInfo`

This struct isn't provided to every endpoint, only to a select few.

It provides you with some information that might be crucial to you, depending on the operation you
want to perform. It contains the sender of the message you just received, and the funds that were
transferred along with it to your contract.

### Defining your own messages

In our examples, you might have seen messages such as `InstantiateMsg`. These messages are actually
_user-defined_, meaning each contract developer has to define them themselves.

To make this easier our `cosmwasm-schema` crate provides the `cw_serde` attribute macro, to define
an instantiate message, you simply write this:

```rust filename="instantiate.rs" template="core"
#[cw_serde]
struct CustomInstantiateMsg {
  initial_admins: Vec<Addr>,
}
```

<Callout>
  This macro actually just expands into a bunch of `derive` attributes.
  We provide this simply for your convenience, otherwise you'd have to keep track of all of these derives yourself.

  <details>
    <summary>Without `#[cw_serde]`</summary>

```rust filename="instantiate.rs" template="core"
#[derive(
  serde::Serialize,
  serde::Deserialize,
  Clone,
  Debug,
  PartialEq,
  schemars::JsonSchema
)]
struct CustomInstantiateMsg {
  initial_admins: Vec<Addr>,
}
```

  </details>
</Callout>
