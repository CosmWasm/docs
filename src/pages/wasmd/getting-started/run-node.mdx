# Run A Node

For detailed instructions on running a node, please refer to
[this tutorial](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/tutorials/3-run-node/). Below,
we provide a quick setup script to get your node up and running.

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to remove the `.wasmd` folder before starting this setup. The
  `.wasmd` folder is usually located in your home directory and contains all the
  data related to the chain. Leaving it might cause conflicts or errors.

## Setup Node

Run the following script to initialize and configure your node:

```sh
# Initialize the node with a moniker (name) and a specific chain ID
wasmd init demo --chain-id=docs-chain-1

# Add key pairs for alice and bob accounts
wasmd keys add alice --keyring-backend=test
wasmd keys add bob --keyring-backend=test

# Add genesis accounts with initial balances
wasmd genesis add-genesis-account alice "1000000000000stake" --keyring-backend=test
wasmd genesis add-genesis-account bob "1000000000000stake" --keyring-backend=test

# Create a genesis transaction for the alice account, making alice a validator
wasmd genesis gentx alice "250000000stake" --chain-id=docs-chain-1 --amount="250000000stake" --keyring-backend=test

# Collect genesis transactions to finalize the genesis file
wasmd genesis collect-gentxs
```

## Start node

To start the node, run the following command:

```sh
wasmd start
```
