# Smart contract

The following sections describe how to create the example smart contract, which manages a counter
that can be initialized, incremented, decremented, and queried. Later on, you will
[write tests](writing-tests.mdx) for this contract using **`MultiTest`**.

<Callout type="info">
  The example smart contract presented in this chapter is a simplified version of the contract
  created based on the [cw&#8209;template](/core/installation#setting-up-the-contract).
</Callout>

## Creating the project

Smart contracts written in Rust are developed as Rust libraries, so let's first create a Rust
library named **counter**.

Change the working directory to your home directory:

```shell copy
cd ~
```

Create a dedicated directory to store your example smart contract:

```shell copy
mkdir my-contracts
```

Change the working directory to `my-contracts`:

```shell copy
cd my-contracts
```

Create a new Rust library named **counter**:

```shell copy
cargo init --lib counter
```

Change the working directory to `counter`:

```shell copy
cd counter
```

Newly created library contains the **Cargo.toml** file and **lib.rs** file in `src` directory...

```shell copy
tree
```

...so the expected content of the `counter` directory is:

```ansi filename="counter"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€Â Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€Â [34;1msrc[0m
Â Â Â Â â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
```

By convention, the source code of the smart contract is placed in file named **contract.rs**, and
the messages processed by the contract are placed in file named **msg.rs**; both files should be
saved in `src` directory.

Let's create the **contract.rs** file...

```shell copy
touch src/contract.rs
```

...and **msg.rs** file:

```shell copy
touch src/msg.rs
```

The final structure of the smart contract project placed in `counter` directory should look like
shown below:

```shell copy
tree
```

```ansi filename="counter"
[34;1m.[0m
â”œâ”€â”€Â Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€Â [34;1msrc[0m
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€â”€ contract.rs
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
Â Â Â Â â””â”€â”€ msg.rs
```

## Filling the content

In the following chapters, we provide examples of different smart contract implementations. Whether
you're interested in developing smart contracts using pure CosmWasm or exploring the Sylvia
framework, the resources below will guide you through the essential content of each smart contract.
