# Contract pinning

<Callout type="info">
  This is done by chain maintainers and not by contract developers. It's not something you need to
  worry about when writing contracts but can be a fun thing to know.
</Callout>

Contract pinning is a feature of the CosmWasm virtual machine which ensures that a previously stored
compiled contract code (module) is started from a dedicated in-memory cache. Starting a module from
memory takes ~45Âµs compared to 1.5ms when loaded from disk (33x faster).

In contrast to the node-specific Least recently used (LRU) memory cache, pinning **guarantees** this
performance boost across the network. As a consequence wasmd can charge discounted gas cost[^1].

<Callout>
  Pinning is an incredibly valuable tool for chains to optimize gas costs. According to a [case
  study][neutron-case-study] by one of our subscribers, Neutron, pinning improved the gas cost of
  their contracts somewhere between 15 and 50%!

## The caches

CosmWasm has 3 different caches for modules:

1. `FileSystemCache` the `.module` files stored in the cache directory of the node
2. `InMemoryCache` the LRU cache
3. `PinnedMemoryCache` a separate cache

Both memory caches (2./3.) work the same in terms of performance but their elements are tracked
separately. A pinned contract is never added to the standard `InMemoryCache` and the size of pinned
contracts is not counted towards its cache size limit.

## Pinning and Unpinning

In order to add a contract to the `PinnedMemoryCache`, you need to call [`Cache::pin`] in Rust or
`func (vm *VM) Pin(checksum Checksum) error` in wasmvm. To remove a contract from the cache use
[`Cache::unpin`] / `func (vm *VM) Unpin(checksum Checksum) error`. In both cases a contract is
identified by its checksum (sha256 hash of the Wasm blob).

The VM does not persist pinned memory entries. I.e. you need to call `Pin` every time you start the
process. This is implemented in [`InitializePinnedCodes` in wasmd][initializepinnedcodes].

At the chain level pinning and unpinning are done via governance proposals. See
`MsgPinCodes`/`MsgUnpinCodes` in wasmd.

When contracts are migrated from one code to another, there is no automatic pinning or unpinning.
This is primarily since the migration of a single instance does not mean all instances of the same
code become unused. In the future we want to provide hit stats for each checksum in order to easily
find unused codes in the pinned memory cache[^2].

## Best practices

Pinning contracts is a balance between increasing memory usage and boosting execution speed.
Contracts that are known to be heavily used should be pinned. This can include contracts that are
executed as part of begin/end block or the IBC light client implementations of the Wasm Light Client
([08-wasm]). If a chain is permissioned and runs on a small number of well known contracts, they can
all be pinned. A permissionless chain might select certain contracts of strategic importance and pin
them.

The estimated size of the pinned contracts is visible in the [Metrics] struct you can access through
[Prometheus]. In order to better estimate which contracts are worth pinning, CosmWasm also exports
metrics per pinned contract.

These metrics are:

- The contract size
- The number of times it was loaded from cache

That way you can better estimate which contracts are worth keeping pinned.

## History

Pinning was developed in 2021 (CosmWasm 0.14) for the Proof of Engagement consensus system of Tgrade
which required certain contracts to be executed in every block.
