# Advanced topics

In this part of the documentation, we go over some more "advanced" things you
can do with the functionality CosmWasm core offers.

<Callout>
  While the name of this section is "advanced", this doesn't mean that we want
  to imply that you only need these functions in advanced contexts. The wording
  "advanced" moreso refers to the fact that you should be familiar with
  endpoints, the structs that are passed to the endpoints, etc.
