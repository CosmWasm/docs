# Introduction

[Storey](https://docs.rs/cw-storey/latest/cw_storey/) is an alternative to
[StoragePlus](cw-storage-plus) and fulfills the same purpose. The
[StoragePlus introduction](cw-storage-plus) could very well be transplanted
here, verbatim - feel free to give it a read if you're not sure what this
software does.

While StoragePlus has been around for years and is the established way of
storing your data on-chain, Storey is the new kid on the block.

<Callout type="warning">
  Storey is currently **prototype software**, meaning the API might change
  rapidly, **storage layout might break between versions**, and you might
  stumble into bugs and missing features. It's probably a good idea not to use
  it for serious production software just yet. If you do, please keep in mind
  the increased maintenance burden and be careful!
</Callout>

On the other hand, it is a solution we want to move toward - we appreciate
anyone willing to help us test it. We also appreciate feedback, feature
requests, and bug reports.

If you decide to give this a try, kudos to you!
